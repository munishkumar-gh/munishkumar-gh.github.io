Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate 
passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase 
letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating 
a new password every time the user asks for a new password. 

Include your run-time code in a main method.

Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. 
For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
