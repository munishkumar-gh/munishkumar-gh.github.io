The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

This solution is based on the following mathematical equations:

1) Sum of natural numbers = n(n+1)/2 where n is the number of terms
2) Sum of squares of natural numbers = (n)(n+1)(2n+1)/6
