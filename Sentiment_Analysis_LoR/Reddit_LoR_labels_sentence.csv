That\'s the point.,0

The buff to Vlad isn’t as impactful as I wanted it to be.,0

Freljord just has too few tools right now.\n\nWhatever Vlad brings to the table other champions can still do better.,1

I don't think this makes him a good champion at all.,1

IMO Vlad requires something drastic like being unable to reduce friendly minions health below 1.\n\nKarma - I'll admit...never enjoyed the play style of this champion.,1
I'm simply not qualified to talk about this nerf.,0
On paper it seems like almost nothing...she was often dropped on turn 9 or 10 backed up by protection spells already.,1
I honestly don't see how this one mana change has a real impact on her use.\n\nShen - Well that buff was unexpected.,1
He trades better but that was never his problem.,1
I can't possibly see how this bumps him up in the champion power ranking much at all.,1
I welcome the change.,1

If summoned off of remembrance turn 3 this thing will feel a lot like those ultra powered stand alone minions did before.,0
I trust this was well tested though so hopefully its not overpowered.\n\nGrizzled Ranger / Badgerbear - Great.,1
Both changes are fantastic.,1
I still plan to run both cards together...that's a sign of a wonderful balance change.\n\nLuarent Chevalier - Solid draw power and removal in one.,1
This was always a compelling card and now the buff ensures its pretty reliable at its role.,1
This could be tough to fit in decks...but there's no denying its a strong 4 drop option now.\n\nStand Alone - Awesome change.,1
Exactly what I wanted.\n\nLegion Rearguard - Not needed.,0
Probably not a popular opinion but this was an easy minion to deal with and had plenty of downsides to balance its buffed stat line out.,1
I feel this was a bad choice to hit if your goal was to weaken aggro decks.\n\nKindly Tavernkeeper - Frejlord badly needed this.,-1
I was running the old version for a while but eventually moved on because 2 power sucks on turn 3 or later.,-1
Love the change.,1
Not even remotely overpowered either.\n\nDeep Mediation - Great change.,1
RIP the 2 drop synergy group of cards though...that concept should get a buff or overhaul in the next patch.\n\nBoomcrew Rookie - Unlike reargard I felt this card actually deserved a nerf and the change they made was the one I was hoping to see.,0
Good stuff.\n\nBrood Awakening - BOO!,1
Look...I get it.,0
But this card found some nice play in more casual fun concepts like Elise Spiders/Kalista/Thresh and Prankster strategies.,1
I appreciate the idea of weakening control decks but I'd have chosen a card that didn't help enable a lot of tier 3/fun decks.\n\nLongtooth - Glad to see this change considering Laurent Chevalier's....I don't think this makes Chum the Waters competitive viable but a buff to fizz is welcome as I feel that champion needed help.\n\nMonkey Idol - No more sitting on the shelf for you...I'm actually going to try this now.\n\nSlotbot - Hearthstone levels of bad RNG.,1
I don't want this card in LoR to begin with so I can only hope the buff doesn't make this card competitive viable.,1
I doubt it will....but either way I feel it needed a complete conceptual rework.\n\nNote:  Unyielding Spirit - I'm genuinely surprised this card got a pass (for now).,0
