"Thats some nice stuff. Only two things bother me:

\- The card stealing is untouched for another 4 weeks. While Bilgewater is a really exciting region, its quite sad that the Steal-cards are autoinclude in every non-Nautilus Bilge-Deck which limits deck building. Its the most efficient way to draw cards in the game and should be a niche-mechanic only worth its mana with synergy (TF, slot bot).

\- Spider aggro (Endure is control guys) is not that good since game release. Even outside of getting stomped by burn aggro, discard aggro (Jinx Draven) had a hard time recently. Now with the toxic Burn aggro hopefully removed all other aggro decks 'lost' 2 of their most important threats. (Healthy) aggro potentially has a really hard time now.",-1

"> I like how they say because Rising Tides gave too much nexus damage....their solution is to nerf non-Rising Tides cards.

Yeah because Rising Tide cards were balanced around the cards currently in the game but cards currently in the game weren't balanced around Rising Tides cards. 

It used to be that not having an answer to legion rearguard turn 1 didn't matter at all because losing the 3 health didn't really matter. But with the addition of demolitionist, fervor, ect. that 3 health really becomes a problem, especially if they're on odds and you have to spend your turn 3 blocking rearguard, which means other units get through putting you even further behind.

Same concept applies to Boomcrew. Taking 4 damage over the course of 3 turns didn't used to be that bad. now taking 4 damage over the course of 3 turns against burn aggro means you you're down to half health on turn 3 because of the other attacks that got through. Now it can be taken out by all manner of things like get excited, gotcha, fervor, grasp ect.

> On Vi....I have to ask, what decks exactly 'synergize with her kit'?

Vi synergies lie with cards that that can be played cheaply and replace themselves or cards that can stall out the game until she can be ramped up from hand. Retreat/Return is good with her, Heimer works really well with her because you get 2 card plays per spell, Draven is an interesting choice because he can generate axes, Static Shock is good with her, Rummage is good, Wardens Prey, Pilfered Goods, Chempunk Pickpocket, Chump Whump, Concussive Palm, Will of Ionia, Glimpse Beyond, Navori Conspirator, Sonic Wave, Trail of Evidence, Veteran Investigator, Flash of Brilliance, Progress Day. 

Decks that she synergizes well in I can think of 3:

Corina Control: Deck aims for late game so if you have it in your hand on turn one by turn 6-7 she should have like 6-8 attack. Now she's a threat when you play her. That's good synergy.

Vi Heimer: Probably the 2nd deck the designers had in mind when they made Vi, Heimer gives you 2 stacks on her a card play which makes it incredibly valuable. Not to mention Heimer runs an assortment of 3 cost spells which makes it really easy to put attack on the Vi even if you don't have the Heimer hyper accelerating her.

Vi Lee Sin: Probably the pairing they were hoping for when Vi was designed it just didn't work out. Decks still sitting at around 50% but Lee is just too heavy of a card to pair with her.

> So you're improving the champion's performance in a deck that doesn't exist?

What? Are you talking about Hecarim tangentially or is that supposed to tie back into Vi? Vi has a lot of decks she synergizes with, and the ability to have synergy with her is versatile. You can buff her through attack buffing cards, Play a bunch of cards to buff her using her own effect or stall out the game long enough to ramp her up.

I really feel like what you're trying to argue here is ""Vi doesn't have a deck that is built around her level up."" Which is true but I don't see how that's a problem. Zed doesn't have a deck based around his level up, neither really does TF, at least not reliably. Hell Heimer isn't even really built around his level up because it doesn't have a health line to not get popped off the board on turn 5. Champions can be good without having to rely on their level up.",1
A free 3 damage if you're going first that'll survive most weenies is okay to you?,1
fair enough. I never saw it as such a big problem when I played against it or with it. I only saw the somewhat higher attack as a problematic side.,-1
"First even without floating anything this could come out turn 4 . Half the stuff you mentioned wouldn’t stop it that early at all. 

Frejlord Combo only works if they drop it when you are attacking AK their idiots. 
Noxus- This wasn’t aimed at helping Aggro decks, and for later it dosnt have a way . 
Shadow Isles- One of the better ways but it’s a turn 7 card that people don’t run a lot of copies of. 
Piltover and Zaun- Probably won’t work if dropped steeply once because you would have to be floating significant mana.  If later turns numerous other cards in those decks stop it for huge temp loss 
Bulge water- Being able to attack it and take it down are two very different things. 

Also it’s not all about balance. It’s about seeing it happen and just basically having to leave at turn 3. At least with Aggro decks decks can prepare answers. This type of combo is all or nothing .",-1
"I'm really pissed off. I'm reading the Patch Notes right now and no changes on Unyielding Spirit left me simply baffled.

Personally, I think there's no reason to put this card into a ""Watchlist"" or whatever since it's totally broken and every player knows it.

Dear RIOT, you're literally pushing me to play broken decks with this card, Fiora, Vi, Kegs and their little friends.

"The card is really good, here is an example: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjoXYnOwHZU&feature=youtu.be

Watch the entire video. its only 2 min long. 

I wish i could record some of my matches and others as well that i fought against US. 
ran into a match where the guy won without US, and played it either way on his round....

Ruination is alot worse to play then US, ALOT ALOT WORSE. 
First of all you don't want any of your units to die w/ ruination and not only that its at round 9. It comes with such a risk, that is barely playable. Either im left w/ 1 card in hand because i had block his units, or its too late by then and he kills me if i don't play my units. (watch video for that example at the end)

"Except, as I have been pointing out, it *isnt*, and it doesnt have a unique feature. Legion Infiltrator also slams in for 3 combat damage.

LoR is *extremely* accessible, so while having no refund system has a sort of sting where other CCGs including even Hearthstone has it... LoR really doesn't need one. If they were to make the game even more accessible then I don't think a refund system would be the best way to do it - more ""Extra Shards"" when you pick up extra copies of cards probably would be. You can swim in Rare and Common Wildcards in this game so you really should spend them quite freely. But it hurts a bit where you spend these Wildcards and then open a Capsule only to see a ton of Extra Shards that are a fraction of what the card would normally cost.",1
"It would be on cards with 4/5/6 health but they have to survive damage and only have 3 health so they are moderately easy to kill off as it is.

Another option would be to cause any crimson units to trigger their actions twice while Vlad is in play but honestly the regeneration would make it a deck vs double triggers making Vlad a bomb for specific crimson units.",-1

"And the difference between 1 attack and 3 is *even huger* for the purposes of burn. Boomcrew Rookie is *technically* a repeatable effect, but the increased damage off of Legion Grenadier can also technically repeat. However, with it at 1/3 now, both get killed in one strike by a 3/2 (which there are many of in the meta). Except the Legion Grenadier takes down the 3/2 as well, while Boomcrew Rookie just gives them a free trade. That is going to be how they both play out most of the time. And its a comparision that Legion Grenadier comes out *way* in favour.

Any 2/3 answers Boomcrew Rookie 1 for 0. Any 4+ attack minion answers it 1 for 0 with only one trigger. Both of those are also extremely common in the metagame. Yes, youre not going to be regularly able to remove it with just one bard before it gets one burn effect through, but then again, Legion Grenadier also gets the one burn effect guaranteed. 

The card didnt warp the meta. Thats just complete and utter rubbish. Think about it, if it did, then it wouldve also warped the meta pre-patch. But pre-patch, burn barely existed. *Corina Control* warped the meta. As it did pre-patch. Burn is a *response* to the control decks, not vice versa. And yes, Boomcrew was the best card vs Corina control. Thats kinda the point. Its great vs control, and a lot less great against decks that actually use units.",1

"Using a Shen/Zed deck with Dusk to Dawn and unyielding spirit is incredibly strong. Throw some death marks into your deck, Greenglade Caretakers, war chefs, the 9/9 Demacian shield card (forget the name), twin disciplines, riposte and lux’s barrier and you’ve got one hell of a deck. You can also add in a Horns if the Dragon for more firepower. The 1 cost Elusive-in-first-round card (Navori Bladescout iirc) is also a great option. 

Be sure to add in some Rush cards (grant an ally +1 and quick attack this round) to keep Shen alive in the early stages. Once you get unyielding spirit and dusk to dawn on Shen it’s pretty much GG as you’ll be able to throw shields on every attacker. You can use death mark to get rid of enemy champs with ease. Don’t forget to bring purify for any Ledros’s or Rimetusk Shamans, as well as any other followers that make you want to rip out your hair.

This is actually less of a nerf and more of a revert since it was originally 6 mana before getting buffed and although it saw a lot less play it was still a viable card for spider decks already and Corina decks weren't top tier yet when it originally got buffed so I think they realized this card was fine in its original design.,1

Regarding Atrocity decks, as soon as you realize that the deck you're facing has it, save your Deny and Will of Ionia. As for Burn spells, you can also protect Yasuo with Spirit's Refuge and Twin Disciplines. You can even recall him if needed. Yasuo being Ionia is already a huge deal because you have access to Will and Deny, which are both unique and powerful. 

As you said, you've been pretty successful. But you can't expect to be favored in every match. There's no deck that counters everything else.",1

Lastly, you also need to consider the fact that you are paying more for the card than they are unless you have a lot of black market merchants. Badgerbear is pretty good at 3 mana, it's much worse if you're paying 5 total for an unplundered card draw and even then only okay if you're plundering.

We need to explore our options and try to make the best change possible.   


We are with you that this card needs a change. We want to address cards that deteriorate the fun and interactive gameplay of LoR (regardless of power level).

I agree. Typically when I play burn I play out my last card or have maybe one remaining when I kill them.

I’m probably going to replace rearguard now since every 1 drop can deal with it and that’s just not worth it for the can’t block keyword,-1

"Rearguard and Boomcrew Rookie nerfs are very impactful. No more free turn 1 plays and lots more cards can deal with Boomcrew Rookie in a single turn. The point isn't to nerf burn decks out of existence though. That's not good balance. They just want to even things out. 

Karma could still be a problem, but they're acknowledging that and seeing how increased mana cost impacts her before doing a heavier nerf or a rework.",1

Brood awakening nerf was totally deserved, the card would fit in almost any kind of deck. Vi balance was spot on, burn nerfs were also totally deserved.

And the ""balance winner"" for me was Vladmir. With the 2/3 crimson somehow dodging the nerf and him receiving that crazy buff I do think he will be meta after the patch. I wonder why they only buffed one champion this patch... /s

The moment you introduce a reward system for masters it draws in more players who don't want the competition for fun, they want it purely for a reward. It turns a game into a skinner box and i would probably stop playing entirely if that were the case.  


Adding in a reward for playing competitive incentives people to use the most degenerate, efficient and powerful decks they can purely to feel as though they aren't missing out on something. It will lead to more overcentralisation and less experimentation as more players just download decklists and ignore the entire point of deckbuilding in the first place which is to find creative or interesting solutions and strategies. people who netdeck like this aren't playing a game anymore they're just doing maths. They don't care about the art in the game, the flavour text, the theme or creativity. just about the numbers on the screen and the probabilities of drawing the card you need next turn.  


I clearly don't support this but i know that most peopl don't give a fuck about any of this and are just going to go download whatever swim made today anyway but i think it's a systemic issue in gaming and enforces very negative gambling habits through gamification and questionable reward systems.",1

"Expeditions pre-nerf were a massive factor, where I'd be playing 3 Expeditions a week and getting 3 Champions a week as a result. There were only one or two weeks before that nerf where I didn't do all three, so my Champion accumulation was very high at the time.

The new system is better for a lot of players who want to build specific decks, not so much for players who want to build *every* deck. On the bright side though, the time investment to get a Champion card (Level 5) or a Champion Wildcard (Level 10) is much, much, *much* less. And this is especially good if you don't care much for running Expeditions to begin with.

But yeah, I've been playing since the start of the Beta, which certainly helps.

Some advice, if you'd like:

Level up each Region to Level 4 first. Get those Wild Capsules so you have a modest wealth of Common/Rare Wildcards. These can help form a decent backbone for any decks you may want.

Until you have acquired the Champion Wildcards you need to get the specific deck you want, consider ""Splash-Champions."" By that, I mean Champions that are broadly versatile enough to be run in a deck without directly being great with it. When I first started playing, I always played Ionia with Zed, but that was also before they nerfed Deny and Inspiring Mentor - two massive boons to Zed's early game performance. 

Other Splash-Champions if you have them include Vi, Garen, Lucian (just as a 3/2 Quick Attack), Fiora, Draven, Tryndamere, Sejuani, Twisted Fate, Miss Fortune, and Darius. They don't just get run in any old deck, but you can see where they might be useful.

And finally, just see if you can think ahead. Do you like a specific playstyle more than another? Do you like a specific *region* more than another? I know I did. I got Ionia to Level 20 before getting any other up to Level 4. If there is a specific Champion that you think you can make a handful of different decks with, then considering going for them first. For example, Zed can work in a handful of different decks as either an Aggro or a Tempo tool, whereas Shen or Yasuo are extremely specialised for Demacia or Noxus decks, respectively. Even if Jinx and Zed are both proactive threats that you like to use, Jinx emphasises emptying your hand as fast as possible and not many decks really use that approach, where Zed seems to be a bit more versatile.

And finally-finally, if you really want a collection faster, do your free Expeditions. Random Epic cards are nothing to scoff at.",1
"you cant. The reason being is the same as why there are no played 6+ mana enchantment aura spells in MTG. As soon as you try to use Unyielding, the card its buffing is immediately destroyed/struck/detained/sent back to hand or the card itself is denied, resulting in an unbeatable tempo swing.  Like you think Mind Meld is unplayable? Imagine doing that to Unyielding.

The best way to fix it while still allowing it to be powerful and not have to change the card much or at all is to just make it only work on Followers and not Champions. The problem isnt the card so much as the design of Champions being near untouchable and unreactable cards unless its to a special few effects. They should have KNOWN it would create problems if they keep making cards like Unyielding. But they keep doing it anyway.",1
"disagree, because I play MF scouts and I can beat Fiora decks. Just because Fiora went online doesn't mean your own gameplan has to be stopped.

(Now granted this is a very specific deck type, but I don't use recall or riptide).

Fiora's gameplan is to get 4 kills, right? My plan is to attack so much times that they can't do anything else. I can use challenger units to force Fiora to block something she doesn't want to while my bigger units destroy the nexus, and use barrier or something to keep the challenging unit alive. 

Of course, US is still overpowered. But, it's possible.",-1

The only indicator of how strong an archetype is, is how it actually performs, and currently they're performing badly.

"Some nice QoL bugfixes we've been waiting for for awhile:

Very glad to see a Karma nerf to go with the Burn Aggro ones. Along with hitting Grizzled Ranger even harder than I expected it seems like they're being proactive about keeping slower Karma/Lux style decks from taking over with Burn not keeping them in check. 

Very nice to see the Vlad and Shen buffs people have been clamoring for, but even nicer to see buffs to underplayed cards that haven't had as much vocal support from players (Hecarim, Kindly Tavernkeeper, Chevalier, Slotbot). One of my favorite things about how they balance this game is that they're always looking to make more things hit the ""this could be included in a real deck"" level of viability, rather than just focusing on the extreme ends of the spectrum. 

I'm also very happy to see a Stand Alone nerf to go along with an explicit ""we'll nerf decks that have unhealthy gameplay regardless of power level"" philosophy. Elusive OTK was far too binary and uninteractive.",1

Coupled with a ton of different spells, as well as a few toughness boosters, Vi is fairly easy to keep alive, and not the only threat in the deck.

"The two parts of my post that you quoted aren't contradictory, they just appear that way when taken out of context.

 I will reitterate my stance in case it wasn't clear: Stand Alone has been nerfed but not into oblivion. It doesn't offer the same line of play that everyone had previously been abusing (3 drop into Stand Alone) but the effect it offers is still very powerful and unique despite being more expensive. It is not dead in the water until other strong permanent buffs enter the card pool.

As for potential targets, Stand Alone probably has potential alongside Fizz, especially since Fizz has received a buff this patch. 

Any other sticky, cheap and evasive unit that is released in future sets is likely to play nicely with Stand Alone. And if Riot fucks up and releases an OP 2 drop, Stand alone could very easily see play along side it.

I probably am being a little optimistic, but I don't think this is a final blow to the card. It's a card that helps with some very degenerate strategies.",1
"Not sure you can, honestly. But that said, I would have gone sideways and nerfed something else: Crimson Disciple dealing 1 damage to the enemy Nexus if she survives damage doesn't *too* badly hurt Swain's level up requirement, and still fully satisfies Sejuani's. Swapping Precious Pet around to a 1/2 might also work, although that's not a very satisfying change at all. I think Grenadier becoming a 2/1 would also be a reasonable nerf, as 2 effectively-guaranteed face damage is nothing to scoff at for two Mana already.

I think Imperial Demolitionist *might* be nerfable to a 2/2, but nerfing her effect is a no-go. If you nerf the face damage, you nerf both the Swain contribution and its efficacy in an aggressive deck. It basically forces the card to be a survive-damage synergy card only and not one that can be used to apply pressure.

As a 2/2 it *might* be an appropriate nerf, but I do quite like 2 Mana 2/3 statlines and her effect provides no immediate tempo. In fact it provides anti-tempo most of the time (since it's not like you're using her effect on Vrynna), so a 2/3 statline should be fine. Not only this but her ""problem"" is Crimson Disciple and how their effects combine for a mighty Decimate on the opponent's face. So nerf Crimson Disciple's effect and it seems... well, it seems to do the trick.",0

And I also think it's kind of crazy to try and claim that the fact that it dies to Grasp isn't relevant. Responding with a Grasp after the burn player has played a Rookie means you are preventing 2 damage and gaining 3 health, effectively netting you 5 health. Against a burn deck, that likely buys you a turn.

On a side note I wish they'd change the burn mechanic to make it disappear if a unit dies before actually attacking (and not just declaring the attack)",-1
"**Top 100 masters thoughts on patch:**


&nbsp;

Vlad? Who’s that? I seen joke posts giving him elite/poro tags. Now don’t give him a logical crimson tag, cos I don’t want to nerf Crimson Curator


Karma will still be best late, however, t6 is too slow vs aggro and you can't just double drop Karma now.


Shen usable, will make his way into a t3 deck min.


Nerf to vi bigger than you think, will be replaced by sej as autoinclude champ.


Loyal is replacable now. Years of extreme hearthstone power creep didn’t even have a 3 mana 4/4 for context.


Grizzled ranger was the best champ in the game. Somehow a 4 mana 8/5 was too weak and had to have a Scout keyword too. To be fair to Riot, maybe its part of their business strategy. Be generous enough to give you many cards, just powercreep so fast so furious your cards will be so worthless so soon :-)

Scout(and Remembrance!) got huge buff no longer useless 5 drop. Well it actually has a name now Greathorn.


Stand alone decks got butchered. Good riddance. If I wanted to play at a casino I want to gamble real cash you know?


Kindly is being underrated by many. People didn’t even think frej had healing cos the shit was so shit. It’s playable now.


Boomcrew is not playable. People are severely underrating the seriousness of this nerf.



Slot bot change is value ohoho.


Monkey idol is pretty decent and is going to be underrated.


Longtooth, big vs shadow isles and shock


Deep med, much needed change, secret buff to heimer


Brood awakening, was hidden op, is a mediocre card now that still has to be played as no alternatives



**Non changes:**


Unyielding: I get that the designers are not sure how to change the card, like whether to change mana cost/spell speed/a combination, but to leave it in its current form is pure negligence. They didn’t have any issues screwing over standalone and boomcrew.


Pilfer: Screws over frejord decks badly, change to draw from bottom of the deck easiest change ever to make?


&nbsp;


**TLDR Meta Predictions:**


Lucian/Senna aggro is the next big thing you heard it here first


Karma still t1, will is too good since unyielding is still here?!


Deep moves up a tier


Bilge moves up a tier (region is too RNG) 


Frej would be great, not just good, once plunder got changed. Controversial I know.


Still, not the worst region in the game. That’s plain rude, and I will not stand for this slander. Why, it is not even close! Say hi to noxus and shadow isles.

"> Some people may get upset about having their own weapons used against them, but that is part of the game.

When we're literally talking about changes to the game my dude, this isn't a valid argument at all.

Imagine if people were talking about thief cards and you were bigging it up as this awesome to play mechanic before Rising Tides and people said ""It's not part of the game""?

It's not an argument, it's just a statement of fact that provides nothing of substance. Yes, pilfer effects are part of the game.

That doesn't stop them from changing it around and altering it. Which, in my opinion, they should. Pilfer effects aren't fun to play against in the slightest, and they're frustratingly difficult to play *around,* as well. There are a number of changes they can make to theft mechanics or cards that would be effective without killing it completely. 

You may get upset if they change it, but frankly speaking you haven't even seen what ideas they've had yet. Asking for them to hands-off of the mechanic when it's both powerful and frustrating to play against is preemptive at best, biased silliness at worst.",1

"Demacia lacks direct removal compared to other regions that’s why they have stronger units. It’s a unit based region since they’re “anti-magic”. 

My main concern is how Ionia is untouched. They still have a million different answers for everything. Heimer Vi will still probably dominate, probably even more so without burn to check it.",0

"I actually wish they gave Hecarim a more significant buff. He can't do anything right now that's significant. And the 1 attack buff doesn't change much. It allows him to trade with 5 mana units which I suppose is significant, but not as significant as a 1 health buff which I feel he really needed. I think the game needs Hecarim to dominate midgame so that cards like Karma cannot just go unchecked.",1
"I don't see the problem in ""nuking it out of existence"" but I may be biased. Imo it's just not fun for your opponent to play a card like that. What they could do also is introduce a ""Path to exile"" kind of card (mtg reference) but you will argue that PtE would make Unyielding Spirit unplayable. Then again, I wouldn't have a problem with this card just disappearing.",1

"Its still weaker than the 3/2 version, that would be the goal, wouldnt it?",-1
I personally like the high risk ( I play scarred mostly) but yes having a heal to allies would help crimson and scarred. I’d prefer him being able to hit 1 dmg nexus whenever an ally survives so it can be a buff to crimson scarred and increase synergy with swain sej Darius gp. But heal would be way better than drain.... drain in noxus... what a day,1
I said it before and I’ll say it again: I don’t think this buff will help Vlad in reality. When Vlad is attacking and not killing the nexus the game is pretty much over anyway for most Vlad decks. I hope I’m proven wrong though and will still continue to play ranked with him of course,1

"IMO fast is a big nerf. If you plan ahead for the fiora (or whatever is going to be USed), you can save your removal for when the opponent plays US, and most of the regions have some kind of removal.

"The card can’t die. The card can be removed from the board.

Making it fast means it can NEVER be a proactive play unless your opponent taps under the least amount of mana they would need to remove it.

So for fiora unless your opponent taps under 3 mana (for most regions) you cannot play the card or you will get countered on the stack.

The card gets better the more reactionary your hand is but it still wouldn’t be good enough to play. There isn’t enough mana after playing an 8 mana card to compete on the stack.

If you want to make it fast the card should cost at the max 6 mana.",1
"You’re naming archetypes and not deck types. Those decks still have to fall under aggro, midrange, or control/combo. Which would create a rock-paper-scissors interaction naturally.

"I have no comment on balancing issues - I’ve only been playing for a few days, and coming from a physical card game background I’m grateful for patch/faq this early and look forward to regular patches not waiting months/years.

However, I’m hoping for some quality of life updates - does anyone have any insight into future plans etc, or how often the plan to roll out new content. A few things that I’d like to see;

-Deckbuilding needs a bit of an overhaul (on mobile) IMO - a quick look at cards when browsing decks, some smarter filtering/view when sorting cards.

-The game lacks draw - for me, not sure if this is a wider issue. But I can’t see many tutoring effects or reliable draw. 

-Again with Mana - could do with some 0 cost cards, some cards that increase mana (I imagine there are some, but haven’t seen every card yet) Turn 1 seems a little prescribed in too many games - I would like to seem some possibilities for rush decks/real attrition. This and the above, for me, both seem to limit deck-building a bit. I’d like to see most stuff that could win turn 3, but also stuff that could win turn 20. Most of my games end turn 9-12 when whoever gets more big guys out first. 

- A ‘neutral’ pool would be good - with some strong flexible cards that don’t count to faction limit. But maybe that’s the background I come from.

- Newly cards acquired need to either flag as new in the card collection or go somewhere else before joining the pool. I often totally miss what I just got.

- A discard pile and ability to look at what’s left in the deck. I spent about 15 minutes looking for the discard pile button before I had to look it up. I get the game tracker on the left side acts a little like this - but in longer games I’d like to see what’s gone/what’s left to get a better idea of likeliness of drawing it.

- A player stats page. I have no idea what my record is like at the moment - which is fine and slightly informed by my ranking, but knowing how decks are performing would be amazing. 

Sorry for the rant - kind of turned into one. Loving the game and got high hopes for it. Remember I haven’t played too much so it’s likely some of these things might be gone with more play.",1

"I think burn will eventually die out if they can't find a good substitute. Runegard nerf is huge, you can trade with him immediately, I think he is a bad card in constructed now. Also, Boomcrew rookie's effect happened at least two times until now for sure. Now you can trade him a lot of times. Eventually this is - 2 followers for the opponent to care and additional - 2 damage which results in a net -6 damage and 5 of these damage generally went to face. Burn has to find these damages from somewhere else or this could be a break point for enough healing to Ionia, Freljord or even Demacia while SI is still favoured",-1
Stand alone got nerfed for good reason . If their playing Fiora or Zed and played that on it good fucking luck . Many regions don’t even have an answer to that,1
"As someone who plays spiders, Awakening isn’t a needed nerf, but it does throw a rock underfoot. Probably just enough to keep the deck from being dominant.",0
I think Cithria being an Elite still counts for something for her though,0
I just jave to say that these are some of the best patch notes I ha e ever seen. Not talking about content but more so presentation and explanation. The League devs should take notes or flat out copy this format. It is amazing and everything is well explained.,1
"Boomcrew and crimson disciple are much bigger issues than rearguard imo.   


I would have liked to see both of those remain as they are with a +1 mana to slow down burn's tempo a bit. At the very least drop the power on disciple to 1/3. s it is that card is guaranteed pure advantage and removing it almost always results in 2 damage or lost board on your side.    


The way i see it is that those two are the cards actually generating the advantage. Rearguard is normally removed pretty early for me and generally i just trade a 2/2 for it if i have to.",0
"People are going to say that Unyielding Spirit didn't get nerfed, but it essentially did because they nerfed Badger and Ranger (double nerf to Ranger), and those were the cards that allowed Demacia to get to the point where they could play Unyielding Spirit.",1
And rearguard was nerfed too,0
"I don't know but in my opinion it's not about getting better its about him becoming a champion. Right now he just feels like a 5 mana dreadway deckhand. I think his level up requirement is stupid, since after leveling up nexus damaging things have no reason to be in the deck anymore. Compare this to sej or Swain who after leveling up still want to damage the nexus every turn to utilize their skills. I think either his lvl up requirement should be changed or his leveled up ability should also have something to do with damaging the nexus.",-1
More sharks,0
"I've always said LoR patches have been pretty consistent improvements, but I think this might be the patch I agree with the most. I do fear burn will still be a little too strong, but Boomcrew should've gotten this nerf a long time ago. Who wants to bet on when Heimerdinger will be moved up to 6 mana?",1
"Kinkou elusive hasn't really been a major part of the meta since Bilgewater was released, but I think the deck will struggle against it due to things like Make it Rain, Twisted Fate, and the fact that Bilgewater has elusives to block with. 

It will probably still be strong but there are more things to keep it in check.",0
Yeah like literally look around the thread and every single comment that criticizes the patch is down voted to hell.. the riot worship is going real strong it seems.,1

I always play Vlad/Braum in Expedition when I can, it's kinda strong there.",1
I think it will be a viable deck karma's lategame is pretty op still. Maybe switch a couple cards and still a solid A tier imo,1
"Its a good point, but I think that the drain still a bit antisinergical, you are right, vs combo decks vlad is going to be a pain in the ass if they fail the combo, but if that happens most of the decks do the same, and crimsons and scars are less effective as the game goes further

To me its a very complex change to really have a solid point of view right now but will be a good point to disscuss as we can try it on play",0
"It's def beatable but it's a situation of ""either you have lethal on deck or you're ionia, or else this is about to get really bad for you"". The experience of playing against it is completely binary, either it was the wrong play and you just win regardless or it was the right play and you insta concede because your deck cannot answer an unyielding champion. It may as well read ""in 3 turns win the game"", and to me that's a pure hand check, LoR's version of a camille ult. Making it fast would at least let hard removal go under it, making it slow would prevent stacking it on expensive removal to negate the cost.",1
Any changes to quinn mf or is not strong enough anymore?,-1
"Actually, we're probably going to see Bannermen & especially Combo decks now that they're not being held down by Burn. I seriously doubt the Grizzled Ranger/Badgerbear nerfs are enough to kill Bannermen completely, and might not even knock it out of tier 1.",-1
"Great horn is a nerf, not a buff: most times I want to pull a 5+ power ally, I want a specific one. Not a random ally.

Moreover, at 5 cost, he is still competing with Quinn. That's not good.",1
"Coming from MTG this seems very natural to me, because both the graveyard and exile are public zones, so anything that goes there (unless specified otherwise) is visible to all players. I know this is kinda different in LoR, because the graveyards aren't accessible at any time (at least yet).

Meanwhile when your card is being yoinked from your deck it moves from a secret zone (your deck) to a secret zone (your opponent's hand). Makes sense to me.",0
"According to my idea he is elusive only when he scouts, he loses elusive upon hitting the nexus, if you want to attack with him again you don't have elusive anymore for the round. 
Also he doesn't have elusive when summoned/played he gains elusive only on round start. 
Which is a perfect translation of his league's passive where he gains invisibility when he doesn't move for 1.5 seconds or he is in a bush for the same time. 

So it's a redesign that incorporates scout, but also opens more counterplay in that he can't be elusive the turn he is played, or after scouting.

I think I wasn't clear on his effect:
Teemo 1:
1 mana 1/1 champion
Keyword: scout.
Effect: round start I gain elusive.
Nexus strike: plant 5 puffcaps, and lose elusive.
Level up: plant 20 puffcaps (cause scout makes it easier to plant).

Teemo 2: 1 mana 2/2 
Keyword: scout. 
Effect: round start: I gain elusive
Nexus strike: multiple puffcaps on enemy deck by 1.5 (so it's by 2.25 on 2 strikes), and lose elusive.",1

"They indirectly nerfed unyielding spirit, and pilfered goods really isn't a problem considering that all decks running it are debatable whether they are even tier 2. and yet they are still on the watchlist. Burn is something they don't want in the meta at all, and they nerfed it without touching any other decks, which was a huge concern. They saw ahead, and tried to figure out which decks would be helped most by the removal of burn, and decided karma decks, especially lux karma, were potential problem. So they nerfed them, along with bannerman strategies, which were looking like the next big thing. They are being light handed and cautious, which is far better than the other side of the spectrum, but they are still prepared to destroy decks they consider unhealthy for the game. Even with these changes, they are  still looking at other cards which, while not problems in the meta, are annoying to go against. My only small complaint about it is that corina control should have recieved a bigger nerf, but meta changes might bring it in line anyway.",-1

"Another point I saw others' made: assume you have two copies of Karma in your hand and you decide to play Karma on exactly turn 10, before, even if the first Karma you dropped got dealt with, you can just drop in another Karma like no big deal. Now, since Karma is 6 mana, you lost your tempo and you have to wait till the next turn to drop in the other karma. So Increase Karma to 6 mana also made a Karma deck more vulnerable to removal, as in it will actually hamper their game-plan, so they need to be more careful and play around this fact.",1
Yeah devs are friendly in every other way so this doesn't bother me too much. Just wanted to know for the sake of planning,1
Vi got nerfed bud.,0
"And tbh if it was for a turn it would make kinda sense as due to their courage and beliefs they would focus all their resolve for that one turn - For that one last fight before they will go down knowing that they did everything they could.

">Fixed an issue where players could sometimes enter a different queue than the one selected.

Oh my word, thank you! This happened to me constantly.",1

That's a net nerf in most situations.",0
"Its a minor downside, but its just one of several downsides. A lot of decks have turn 1 plays. All turn 1 plays trade favourably into rearguard (And I mean legitimately ***all*** of them). You get just less value out of it than legion infiltrator.",1
Add a Radiant Guardian for more damaging without damaging and healing.,-1
"Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the changes. I did not actually anticipate the change to [[Legion Rearguard]] - I thought it was alright, but any nerf for Burn will do. I would've also preferred seeing [[Loyal Badgerbear]] to be a 4/3, but even just making it a 3/4 helps a bit when it comes to pushing damage.

Gotta love these buffs to [[Shen]] and [[Kindly Tavernkeeper]]. I knew they were gated by their low attack, which prevented them from blocking Fearsome units that are more prevalent in decks they are meant to be better against.

I'm also glad for myself that I did not throw in my Champion Wildcards on Vi and waited for the patch notes to come.

This might bring back a bit more of a control meta again, which might bring back combo decks, aswell as it may give my shallow strategies revolving around infinite value a time in the spotlight. :D 

Obviously people will probably still find a good aggro and midrange deck to maintain the balance.",1
"Elusive are just slower burn. Yeah if changes would make burn weaker than burn, they would come out of shadow, but resisting pressure from slower burn is a lot easier then from original burn.",1
I think the vi change is pretty big. She now falls to 5 damage units which there are a lot of. Also tough makes every point of health more valuable. I think she'll still be good but she defenitley takes a hit. She can also be thermod on turn 5.,1
"It's on the watchlist, it'll be nerfed a month from now",0
"Sorry, I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic. Despite being someone who doesn't play burn, I can tell you that burn isn't as brain dead as it is. And a bad hand decreases your wr by a huge margin, especially at near masters to masters rank. I don't think that they buffed the other decks to win burn, they just allowed other decks to play around burn easier. I'm pretty sure as the meta develops, burn will drop to tier 2 or low tier 1 when people know how to play around it. If you nerf burns damage, then it wouldn't be a burn deck anymore. Burn keeps its identity while being easier to win against.",1
Found the Burn aggro main,0

"Hey Rubin, this topic means a lot to me so I wanted to chime in. I want to start with this: Anyone who loves Unyielding Spirit and wants it to be kept the way it is, and who would like to see many more super interesting cards like this added in the future, please upvote this comment right here. Don't let the vocal minority scare you into silence. You can't be harassed or downvoted if you just upvote a comment (and that is what's happening, some of the friends I've asked didn't know this card was under attack on Reddit, and the ones who did said they haven't defended the card because they are afraid of the backlash others have been receiving for defending it).

So if you love this card, this is how you can be heard: Upvote this comment.

For a little background: I've been playing Magic for a long time, and the thing that really makes it shine is the huge scope of card effects. My favorite format is Legacy, since it allows for cards from any number of different sets to be mixed together. I especially like coming up with crazy combos and running alternate win conditions.

In comes Runeterra: The first card game I've played that felt like it had any of the charm of Magic. In the first set was Fiora, which already gave me a lot of faith in the game, since I never expected an alternate win condition to be released in the first set of cards. In the second release, we got Unyielding Spirit, which is another very Magic-like card. The friends I play with have said they love this card, and I'm sure many others do too: They just aren't going to rally on Reddit to tell you so, because they either don't realize they should or they don't want to get downvoted by the vocal players opposing the card and the philosophy it embodies.

In Magic, there are so many card effects that are more powerful and cheaper than this. There are creatures that negate all damage to themselves by default. There are permanent cards that can negate all damage to all your creatures for the rest of the game. There are permanent cards that can negate all damage to yourself. There are even cards that can swap your life points with another player's life points, or make it so you don't die when you go into negative life points.

These cards exist to allow a player to pull off an upset, or dramatically change the game state with a single play. Of course sometimes they just don't work out, but when they do it feels very rewarding. When the person on the other end is playing a more straightforward deck, they may dislike immediately going from a strong position to a weak one, but that's just human nature.

In Magic when that happens, people just figure out how to make their own deck stronger and how to advance their own win condition more quickly, rather than try to convince Wizards and the Magic community that all these wonderfully interesting cards that are inconvenient to them personally should be nerfed out of usefulness.

The reality of Unyielding Spirit is it's not ""too good"". People say it can be played on turn 5 and there's no way to stop or counter it, but that's completely wrong. If it's played on turn 5 then that means the user completely skipped 2-3 turns out of their first 5 turns, otherwise they wouldn't have enough mana. Even then, they end up with no mana remaining, so they're handicapped on their next turn as well.

In early stages of the game, there's a huge window for players to respond to the card, because a player doesn't have enough mana to play a unit and also play Unyielding Spirit on the same turn. If the unit they put down is some kind of engine (like Fiora), that gives the opponent at least a whole turn to deal with it, and anything the Unyielding player uses to defend their engine (like Barrier) makes it so they can't use Unyielding Spirit on the next turn either (since they won't have enough mana still).

Imagine if this card was fast speed, like what the detractors started asking for. There is so much fast, cheap unit removal that this card will be unplayable on any unit with 1 or 2 health, and won't be worth the risk to play on units with 3 health. It would become an extremely inconsistent card that completely strips out most of its usability. Of course for the people making these demands, this is what they want, even though nerfing any card that challenges their style of gameplay is unhealthy for the game.

Players like having an answer to everything, and so far that has largely been the case for players stacking unit removal: These cards are always valuable so there's no downside in filling your hand with them. Now when you do manage to play Unyielding Spirit, you're making *some* methods of unit removal unusable against *one* card, and people who've felt like they always had an answer for everything since the game started just aren't happy about the game going in a direction where more things are possible because it's less convenient for them.

I don't think people should be demanding nerfs to cards because those cards make them play outside their comfort zone. That's the point. Literally every single region can absolutely crush someone who is using Unyielding Spirit, but sometimes the best way to win is to just debuff or play around the Unyielding unit, and these players don't like the idea of advancing their own wincon faster than the enemy, instead of advancing their wincon by completely dismantling the enemy.

Basically, Unyielding Spirit embodies the Magic game development philosophy, which is a philosophy I feel is extremely healthy for a game like this. No matter what deck you run, the opponent's deck could have no answers for it, or the opponent's deck could have every answer for it. Every game is different, and many cards can completely flip a game on its head by themselves, when you manage to get the game conditions just right for them (which can be difficult to do with Unyielding Spirit already, since the enemy often just drops more units than you with all their extra mana and you never have a chance to catch up before they overrun you).

Someone who just stacks unit removal goes up against a player using Unyielding Spirit and feels like they had no way to stop it. Instead of coming up with ways to improve their ability to deal with it, they go onto Reddit and say it's terribly broken. What they didn't see is the 8 games before that which the Unyielding Spirit player lost, because they got heavily outnumbered, or the card they were going to buff got removed before the next turn started, or the card they buffed got stunned/recalled/challenged/debuffed into unusability.

Let's say there's a deck that can only win 1 out of 3 games, but most of the games it wins are a complete one-sided slaughter. That deck is not problematic. What matters is how often a deck wins, not how one-sided the win is when an opponent has no answer to the deck's mechanics. Not every deck should have an answer to every other deck. The game would be horribly stale otherwise. It's up to the person building the deck to construct it to be as versatile as possible.

\*\*\* (PS: Please add a card to this game that's equivalent to Platinum Angel :D It's a creature in Magic that says ""You can't lose the game and your opponents can't win the game."" It's one of the most fun ""oh crap the objective of this game just changed"" cards. Usually what happens is the enemy full attacks you to get you into negative life points, and then a mini-game ensues of them trying  to remove Platinum Angel while you're simultaneously trying to keep it on the board and beat the opponent. If at any point Platinum Angel leaves the board, you instantly lose since you're at negative life points by then. It's a super fun card. Definitely my favorite Magic card!)

tl;dr: What needs to change here is the mentality of the vocal minority opposing Unyielding Spirit, not the card itself. This card should remain intact, and **many more** interesting cards like it should be added to the game. Please upvote this comment if you agree.",1

"I don't hate midrange at all. In fact, I try to force it with Demacia in expeditions whenever I can =P. I don't have a particular hatred for bannerman--the staple midrange deck in this game--at all. I just think that whenever people talk about aggro, they talk about one very particular type of aggro.

""I'm going to play little dudes and try to swarm you, and maybe play the very occasional direct damage, so please don't play slightly bigger dudes or AoE effects or I'll be very sad.""  

The moment aggro players go off the beaten path, and add a bit of a twist that makes basic blocking a little tougher (see: fearsome, elusives, burn), all hell breaks loose. 

Aggro can't just be ""little dudes and nothing else"" forever, because we'll have more challengers, more AoE effects (EG make it rain), more good defensive techniques, etc. added as time goes on. Get what I'm saying?",1
"> updating some of our internal metrics to better cover metagame health. For example, we’ve begun looking at top meta decks over time to evaluate how well they successfully test player skills such as within-game decision making, deck building skills, adaptability, etc. Similarly, we’re more broadly analyzing which parts of the meta are occupied by top decks, in order to help inform changes that encourage a wider variety of competitive archetypes.

"My point is that Vlad wont be played. The problem with vlad decks is not running out of health on your nexus, its running out of health on your units. vlad has anti synergy with your deck and that didnt change so he still wont be included. 

Yes i know some of the crimson cards benefict from taking damage, but you like to do this in a controlled manner. Nuking your own board on turn 5 its usually not a good thing. What happens 90% of the time you play Vlad is that you attack with 1-2 less units and end up doing less damage than what you would have done if he didnt had that stupid effect.

On the other hand the Shen buff is smaller sure, but you would actually get to use it because he was already playable.",0
"Yeah, I do agree rearguard was a problem, but i'd argue the amount of burn in the game is a bigger one, and should have been prioritized with the nerfs.

I disagree that rearguard is ""still pretty strong"" though.

I think best-case scenario it may one day be playable in a meta where tokens and 1 drops are rare.",0

"> The same to changing it. The mechanic itself is balanced,

Doesn't mean they can't change Pilfered Goods, for example.

"Can you pass the feedback on new wordings to those who are responsible for them?

Changes like the one to Make It Rain are more confusing since they are not written in clear English. If you want this game to be played by everyone over the world you need to adapt wordings to be clear. 

Deal 1 to three different randomly targeted enemies including enemy units and enemy Nexus.

Done. Shorter and less confusing than the one I saw. Avoid among, three times etc. New wording I saw on reddit is worse than the old one. ""Deal 1 three times"" could also be understood as dealing 3 dmg to each of three units but in succession so total 9 dmg.

"Can we just please get a nerf to the mystic shot on the nexus? Getting really old losing to multiple of them. 2 mana for 2 damage directly to the nexus is just incredibly obnoxious. Decimate is 4 damage for 5 mana and can ONLY go to the nexus, but mystic shot is 2 for 2 and can ALSO target elusives. I feel like it should cost more for how versatile it is

Edit: 27 downvotes with 0 responses on how it’s balanced. Must’ve found 27 ez/karma abusers :)",-1
Happy they see a problem with undying spirit.....sad they aren't fixing it yet and won't be able to for another month :(,0
That's true but you can't look at the card In a vacuum. Overall bilgewater needs that strength so as long as it's not Uber toxic like how it is into the feel match up by drawing from the bottom it would be a solid card for it's region. If you need it much the region kind of goes in the trash bin minus deep,1
"The middle of the month patch isn't a balance update, they only balance patch once a month.",0
Apparently you did.,0
That Hecarim change from a 5/6/c6 to a 6/6/6 was ultra needed imo,0
"Boomcrew Rookie was exactly the wrong card to nerf. It's one of the workhorses of all P&Z aggressive strategies and apart from burn they weren't looking too hot right now as is. Huge whoops by taking out discard aggro as collateral damage. Aggro needed no nerf (Spider & discard that is) not this and there are plenty other options to hit burn.

&#x200B;

P&Z Shadow Isle control also got battered with the bat. Brood Awakening at 6 is not good enough of a card, which we already know because that what it once was and the power level of the game didn't decrease.

&#x200B;

The buffs all look good, as buffs most often do and I'm really happy about the Ranger and Badgerbear.

&#x200B;

edit: Typo with Aggro in general needing a nerf, it really does not.

&#x200B;

note: This sub is infested with an ""AgGrO bAd"" mob that apparently doesn't understand what a game devolves into without viable aggro options.",-1
Eat the trash?,0
"Swain is fine, he is just not played because who needs Swain when the burn spells can already kill the nexus by the time Swain levels up. But if Swain + his ship is on board it's pretty much a guaranteed win against any unit centered decks.",0
"I agree, expeditions honestly dont feel like they are worth my time",1
"He was sort of unplayable immediately vs Demacia, you needed to bait out their mana before you could drop him, otherwise he dies to single combat vs Garen or Cithria. At least now he trades well into Garen and GP (no one uses him though). It also only takes 1 Vile Feast or Wail to kill Sej on top. 

Leveled up he actually kills and survives the 5/5 Tough units from Demacia, which is important since before you couldn't attack and have him survive when the Lux Karma summoned either Radiant Guardian or the other guy from Rememberance (or just Radiant Guardian in general).",-1
"Your karma change will outright kill her, what needs to be changed is her champ spell which is the primary issue, and also the the fact that she enables degenerate combos with other champs (like ezreal and lux). I think the best way to rework her is to create a fleeting copy of a non-fleeting spell after it resolves, so slow/fast spells will give your opponent an extra turn of priority to respond and shes not insanely busted with Lux. And then ezreal could get reworked so he can no longer get damage out of spamming burst spells.",0
Ashamed.,-1
"Much better than *haha damage go brr* every 19 out of 20 games, both on normal and ladder",0
It’ll go live at around Thursday 12:30-1:30AM-ish SG/HK time,0
Sounds promising,1
"Suggestion for Unyielding Spirit that isn’t making it a fast card:

- For the one round the unit cannot take damage or die, if the target was in combat this turn place unyielding spirit on the top of your deck. (This way it has a clear trade off, while having some counter play and kind of retaining the idea of the card) 
- Target an ally. Remove all other card effects of the target; it cannot take damage or die. If it would be targeted by a card effect or spell, remove this card’s effect instead and obliterate this card. 


I feel there are ways to balance this card without breaking but retaining the appeal of the card.",0
"Of course I've never played it, but from my understanding facing it a lot in the ladder was that it is just a bit slower aggro with more base stats value for face hitting, less combo, less counters and honestly, seems pretty boring to me (yes, even when compared to burn). At least I need to learn to play around draining with burn since more than half of my opponent was using an Shadow Isles deck.

I may consider trying it if I somehow got all the cards but I don't think it is something I should craft, especially now when I just got bored with burn.",1
"You got down voted because for a card game, Lor is incredibly generous with rewards as it is. You get progression rewards tied to xp and quests, and once every week you get the vault rewards that if you get to lvl 12 you get 3 diamond chest, 1 champion wildcard and 1 expedition token. You can get the vault to lvl 12 by playing around 2 hours everyday. 

Personally, coming from hearthstone where, if you do quest (1 per day) you get either an arena run for 3 quest or a 5 card pack for 2 quests and legendaries are incredibly hard to get and when you get one, sometimes it's a trash one, I feel like the rewards in this game are more than enough, and creating decks is fairly easy with wildcards instead of the dust system in hearthstone where you get less than half the value of a card you disenchant.",1
Don't think so,0
I actually used champ shards for 2 copies during beta thinking I could find a home for him. Then Swain came and told him to sit down.,1
No. Teemo should remain in the hole of dirt he dig for himself and never crawl out again.,-1
Half the suggestions are quality of life suggestions and are good.   The rest will just come with more expansions.,1
Yes goddamn besides Demacia has the best shields and buffs,1
"What the fck? US unchanged? Not even make it fast or slow? What the fck riot think creating an immortal card on board is ""fine""?",-1
"It only affects freljord, its actually a buff versus non freljord decks because stealing from the bottom means you are not increasing enemy chances of drawing their champions",0
Yes!!!,1
"the issue with hec is keeping him alive through multiple attacks. He gives 28% of his level up every swing, but i don't send him into combat because he will die by the time I can play him. Unless I get lucky and my opponent doesn't kill my ephemerals before they swing he is not ready on curve. More health and less attack would have been better actually.",0
"Karma's nerf was enormous. Alongside nerfed meditation, she's going to be much more difficult to manage. 

Heim worked well because Vi was so nasty in the mid-game managing the board, and losing one health for her is big.

Aggro is not dead. You will likely see more of the discard package or champion-ful lists included in new iterations of pnz/nox lists. They will not be as quick, but will have greater reach. You might also see Fizz lists finally begin to arrive, as they were just slightly slower than burn in the last patch while also getting absolutely annihilated by them.

Demacia was by far and away the most successful single faction in the game. They also weren't the ones keeping control in check. Control (Spooky Karma, CorVina) absolutely that on them, and they were really the only lists that could. The Demacia nerf will see more tempo-oriented builds that couldn't handle mid-game 4/4s come to the surface.",1
"Hes a niche card now, when people forget about 1 drops, he'll come back every christmas to remind us",0
But not unfair or bonkers like boomcrew and grizzled,1
Is that also for mobile users or just pc?,0
"They didn't really hit control.  Just brood awakening, but that was used in every SI deck practically.",0
"There are only a few things I think really need nerfs: Grizzled Ranger, Karma, Vi, Boomcrew Rookie (possibly a different piece of burn?), maaaaaaaaybe Unyielding Spirit. There's a lot more stuff you could potentially buff: Hecarim/ephemerals, Vladimir, Freljord... I see where you're coming from.

I will still be upset if we don't see nerfs on the things I listed, though.

Edit: This did indeed turn out how I hoped. We'll see how some of these things shake out (is the Karma nerf enough? Was it really necessary to nerf the badgerbear?), but I think this was a great patch.",1
"Why? Is it wrong to use the word ""like"" if i am writing? English is not my first language but i didn't know about that one to be honest",1
"But then he won't be a scout, and we'll his league title is ""the swift *scout*"" also half his voice lines are about scouting (also in LoR) so tried to implement scout without breaking him while buffing him as well. So you could change him to plant 4 puffcaps instead, it would make him better as he gets to attack more, opens up synergies with Quinn and MF.",1
You actually can't. I've learned to play without sound and I don't look at cards too much...,1
"Used to be? Damn, ut still feels like beta to me.",0
I usually put shadows on the right just because at that point it’s game over and so that his level buff kinda distracts the attention from the real Hec because at that point the other two got 15 power or so depending on what else is in play.,0
"It wasnt a really fun card before, but now its completly unplayable. Luckily noxus has a lot of other good 1 drops.",1
"Freljord: rimefang wolf + freeze.  Culling strike if paired with Noxus.  
Noxus: they skipped turns 1 and 2? Okay, you win.  
Ionia: will.  
SI: vengeance.  
Demacia: challenger + riposte.  
PnZ: thermo beam.  
Bilgewater: the 2/3 that makes the strongest enemy unit vulnerable. Still have to kill it, but you dictate what it fights.  

Sometimes, you're down 1 mana on the exchange (EG vengeance for 7 vs. 3+3 for Fiora + stand alone), but paying 1 mana to be up a card is huge.",-1
"Nexus Strike: Heal all allies 1

I would also love to see him deal 1 to all defending characters. Something to make him harder to play around.

Or

""When an ally survives damage Drain 1 from the enemy nexus""

Something to give him a touch more viability",0
This might be the worst balance suggestion I might have ever seen so far lol,0
"I know that Ezreal emote is supposed to be Very Nervous but also all I can think of is that's a very ""Oh No He's Hot"" Gay Panic emote.

Which is fitting given the rainbow poro is also in this patch.",-1
"Did you even try with bilgewater? The deck isn't tier 1, but it still has more options for drawing and discarding than what noxus could dream of providing.",0
War Chefs needs a nerf too. A lot of Demacia cards could use one. But reddit doesn’t want to talk about that.,-1
that's good to hear. I already have Garens so I'll sit back and watch the new meta for a bit (which are already coming out).,1
"What kind of buff are you looking for?

Yasuo's problems are systemic, not raw power.

This isn't a problem you can keep throwing stats at and call it a day. Yasuo's whole thing is that stuns fundamentally don't jive with what Yasuo wants to do: 

Stuns want to ignore what's on the board to push damage to face, Yasuo wants to use stuns as removal instead. 

Top it off with Yasuo being kind of inconsistent (the games where you don't draw Yasuo are rough), it's not really an issue they can address in a patch: This is an issue that's going to require new cards.",-1
"The day changed with this patch, actually.  They announced it in the 1.1 patch notes but this is the first patch where it's going into effect.",0
"&#x200B;

Agreed.  Out of all the CCG's I've played, MTG Arena included, the ability to purchase (with wildcards or currency) select cards is briliant for deck building and getting a good start on the game without much grinding or any cash expense.

Because of this, I'm more likely to buy the vanity stuff to support the game.",1
It change 2 of mf/quinn cards,0
"> This sounds like a good change but adjusting the cost to 11 or 12 might and changing it to Fast might cover it.

... What?

Mate put that nerf-nuke away holy shit.",-1
"So just like any other high cost spell i.e Ruination, Dawn and Dusk? 

It's a fair nerf you'll have to be careful when you cast it, keep counter spell back up and buffs and barriers if your opponent tries to burn the unit you're buffing.",0
"I don't think control will take over tbh, there are actually quite some midrange decks that see play already but are tier2/3 due to them losing to aggro and demacia most of the times. E.g. decks containing: MF, Seju, Swain, TF or even some Shadow Isles midrange stuff. I'd say those decks have a quite healthy winrate against control decks, just round about 50%.",1
Thanks for the explanation. Will cards like Detain and Purify be able to deal with that?,1
"Feelings aren’t what matter here. Facts are. And the fact is that burn has a very low win rate against control and Demacia has more playrate amongst its 7 variations, higher win rates on average, and a >50% winrate against aggro. 

Demacia was already dominating the meta pre-xpac and Riot didn’t touch a single one of the cards that caused it to be S tier before the meta.",0
Imagine being so sensitive that you uninstall just because a couple of cards got nerfed 😂,0
"Idol is still bad, if it wasn't immobile it would be a good take heart target.",0
"Final note: they had a large share of the ladder because people were using it to climb because the average match time playing burn is a third of control’s. 

Burn has already seen almost a 50% decrease in playtime and Demacia decks actually have MORE games played total right now!",1
"Buffing a card is way riskier than nerfing a card. It contributes to speeding up long term power creep which is a problem that inherently exists in CCGs. Power creep destroys games until the games decide to rotate cards.

Buffing cards also often leads to a smaller effective card pool in terms of competitive cards because a busted card can sometimes push multiple entire decks out of viability, whereas nerfing an OP card usually only impacts decks that are already pushing other decks out of the meta. 

Players tend to prefer hearing about buffs than nerfs because buffs introduce shiny new toys, but it is far better for the game to prioritize nerfs over buffs for the sale of a healthy metagame.",1
Why would Lux need a nerf? She is in an incredible spot and is only played in 1 deck. Karma is the clear issue in the list. Karma breaks both Lux and Ezreal. Ezreal and Lux do not break Karma,1
Feels weird only having 12 patches a year coming from league tbh. I'd like if they still did smaller balance patches in between. Maybe stuff like changing draw from op deck to be from the bottom.,1
">Brood Awakening

That card was also strong in Endure Spiders and even if it's more expensive the card will still see play as they need those little bastards to buff the beasts and defend!",1
"Counterplay?  What the fuck is that?

--burn players",-1
"Some of the self harm creatures are decent vlad was just a bad champ, I think this buff will help a lot they probably just need to give a small buff to 1-2 other units in the archetype and he's fine

Would say hecarim looks pretty strong now but ephemeral archetype just sucks. The 3/1 evasive creature should go to 3/2 and they need a buff to their single target removal. Maybe 4 damage if a creature died this turn instead of 3? As of now its strictly worse than the card that does 3 to any ally + 3 to any target.",-1
"Omen hawk does nothing to precious pet.

Also, fair chance burn switches rearguard for teemo.",0
"Funny how all those streamers and pro players keep playing League even though there are plenty of other options available. It’s almost like it’s the best one on the market...

The toxic part of the League community is definitely coming out in your comments",1
"I don't think they get nerfed enough to influence the matchup that much.

Ez/Karma was weak against Bannermen before Grizzled Ranger powercreeped the deck, and burn aggro is basically the same. The Legion Rearguard nerf impacts the deck vs Bilgewater, Freljord and SI more than anything. At best, Karma/Ez can Thermo beam on Boomcrew. Disciple and Demo still wreck it too fast.",0
"Completely agreed.  Rearguard already doesn't contribute to face damage unless your opponent has no 1 drop, but at least, at 2 health, it was a 2-for-1 half the time; now it's a trade at best.  Compounded with the Rookie nerf, burn aggro's consistency just went *way* down.",1
"Lmao both are miles ahead of Vlad. In fact, Vlad shouldn’t even be considered here, he’s just straight up garbage, even in the decks that are supposed to support him",1
"Your words speak for themselves. I never called you a robot, I said the game shouldn't be designed for one.

You have fun playing pilfer. Hear that? **Fun.** You're probably not a robot.

Good attempt at twisting my words, but next time you should just take my point and acknowledge it in good faith, rather than acting offended.",1
"The only reason for playing that card on turn 1 instead of the other options was against PnZ because of beam, now you can replace him with teemo, is probably better",1
read again,0
Yeah no more is an hyperbole I think. But it’s definitely weaker,0
When is patch dropping?,0
im getting it,0
"I mean, its more of a nerf to corina control and endure than anything else. they need to buff noxus spiders or add a good noxus spider payoff if they want spider tribal in the game.",1
"Yeah, I get that.

What's wrong with prompting discussion on a discussion thread though?",0
"""spend money""",0
"Exactly. 

Riot wants to print MTG power level enchantment style spells...without any of the counters MTG also offers. Or at least many fewer, less efficient counters. I mean, in MTG, Will of Ionia is a 1-2 mana Fast spell, tops.

Riot cannot continue to print MTG level buff and burn but only Hearthstone caliber removal. Its just bad design.",-1
How can you say burn didn't get touched when both rear guard and boom crew got nerfed?,0
"I played burn for a while and kept some stats - I noticed that if I attacked first and mulliganed for a Rearguard or Pet, I would win every single time.",1
"karma/lux is a lot weaker. especially with nerfs to bear brothers. i think it will still be viable and was the deck was what i was spamming, but the early game nerfs will make it hard to drop karma turn 6, whereas it was pretty easy before to just drop her turn 5",0
"But he is, there's no way to paint him as a good champ currently",1
"I played against it quite a bit as Karma/Lux and winning against Burn if they were on the play was basically impossible.

I’d be curious to see the win rate for Burn for when it was on the play versus on the draw.",1
I agree. Burst mechanic needs to go or used very limited.,0
Lucky for you burn was the worst matchup for karma lux.,-1
It being a horrible card is good imo.,0
"> midrange's niche ~~was~~ is the strong turn 3-4 drops that people struggled to deal with.

Neither of the cards that got it in bannerman got hit through health. It's gonna be just as hard to get a badger bear off board now as it was before. At most your opponent might be able to save 1 card over the course of turns 3-4.

> those two cards were the whole center why people even played midrange.

That's not even close to being true Bannerman was the undisputed best deck before Rising Tides came out.

When I saw Ranger I immediately thought ""Oh that cards getting nerfed within 3 patches LoR devs going for that league design of making cards drastically overpowered when they come out."" 

And I literally thought Badger Bear was a misprint. I thought he was exclusively going to be something that got summoned off of Ranger and the fact you could even add a 3 mana 4/4 to your deck was fucking stupid and it made 
me question how much of a problem power creep was going to be in this game.

And my point overall was that Bannerman Midrange didn't really take a hit, they put in line with where they should have been in the first place. And that place is still above probably every other deck in the game in terms of consistency.",1
"Karma nerf litterally will change nothing. They choose not to tune burn damage but weaken 2 cards from it which is probably means almost nothing (if you do not have parley). No  touch to unyielding spirit, no touch to steal mechanic, no touch to Ezreal. Litterally trash patch...",-1
"why not put US at 7 mana and slow instead of burst. 

You have to give every player a chance to counter it...

Its granting a powerful effect, that is a win condition, especially with units like fiora or the 5/5 lifesteal Radiant Gaurdian unit. Add that with other things like Dawn and Dusk, then they have 3 units that are US. which is game at that point. 

if a card like Dawn and Dusk can be at slow, why can't Unyielding spirit be slow??? and should be more mana than Dawn and Dusk.",1
Valid point! 😮🤔,0
"Same reason burn is so hard to deal with, too many mechanics are hard locked to a region. Healing is very rare outside of SI and Will of Ionia is the only widely played way to deal with Unbreakable Spirit, in a game without sideboarding you need to have more generally decent answers to cards that it's worth including them even when you won't run into what they're good at.",1
"She had great synergy with bannerman, who cast lots of low cost cards on curve and can buff her via war chef, cithria, bannerman, etc.",0
Teemo needs love!,1
I really hope they focus more on buffing rather than nerfing. Some nerfs are needed but if there are no major buffs I will be disappointed,-1
well hecarim doesnt have tough so idk,0
"There is nothing wrong with them being Tier 1, though there is also nothing wrong with any faction being tier 1 aside from the fact all factions should have tier 1 options to diversify play.",1
Ezreal and Pilfered Goods are fine. As someone who plays ranked exclusively I almost never see them.,1
"Will the Hecarim buff actually mean anything for the ephemeral archetype? Besides nerfing brood, I can't see how the buff matters.",0
"Kinda a small patch, would have expected more. Also as seeing that more engines got a HP buff, very suprised Prankter didn't get one to be 0/4.

Hecarim and Vladimir need more tho, the problem isn't the champs but their support cards (Ephemeral and Self-Harm) are pretty bad.",0
"The Karma ""Nerf"" is a joke...and now with the really nerfed burn decks it will be the most played deck and it's so lame to play against it over and over. I don't want to have to build my deck only to beat Karma, Ez. Redesign or a max of 2-3 Spells per Round would be cool. But this 1 Mana will change nothing.

Unyilding Spirit...fuck this card. It's bullshit. Just redesign it or put it out of the game.

The other changes are ok with me. I can't really understand the 6 Mana for Brood Awakening, but because I am not an Elise Player it's fine for me, but still weird.",0
I was wondering if that was the bug or I was only getting matched with opponents who chose the same icon :p,1
"Tbh Shen got a massive buff, expecting Shen + Fiora decks to rise in the new meta",0
Touche.,0
"Patch note coming out today, distributed tomorrow, live Wednesday.",0
I can't believe they didn't change unyielding spirit. or even fix pilfer effects to reveal what gets stolen.,-1
*smiles in combo*,0
"Yes, enemy could just bank his mana to 3 spell mana and summon a solitary monk to Stand Alone it to get a 7/4 elusive. That shit was hard to answer and if she rallied you practically auto-lose the game.

Even worse if he manages to stand alone a zed.",-1
I'm new to LoR. Is there a refund system for those who have nerfed cards? I played Shadowverse for years and when a card is nerfed you can get the full value back. Is that the same here?,1
"Rearguard really needed a nerf? He can't block, does nothing if the opponent has a 1 drop, and nearly every spell besides vile feast kills him. I can justify the Boomcrew nerf, but nerfing Rearguard is just kicking the deck while it's already down lol",0
"\-wii fit trainer voice-

Breathe in.

Breathe out.

Now slowly raise your dongers.",1
Mate its a shen vlad deck... So noxus ionia... Its not frejlord so all your questions are in the wrong region lmao.,0
Everyone saying that Vlad got a huge buff and Shen buff is irrelevant and i'm here thinking quite the opposite...,1
She actually has 1 less hp. Not sure this is enough though...,0
"but most units at turn 1 have only 1 power, so rearguard can make a positive trade even if he can't damage the nexus. At 1 hp there isn't a single positive trade he can do anymore",1
""" you shouldnt be on the internet if you cant handle other peoples opinion ""

"" ive reported you 😭 ""

This kind of irony and thinking is why you get downvotes and cant grasp why. Now wonder youre that ungrateful.",-1
"Stand alone definitely needed a nerf, but I agree on unyielding spirit that thing needs to be at least 10mana",1
Vlad needed a complete redesign. Yet another Riot failure.,-1
"In any Shadow Isles control deck it was always useful at almost any point in the game. For a control deck that flexibility is very powerful. Blockers? Here's 3 of them. No threats? Here's 6 damage. Need some fodder for sacrifice? Here's 3 targets. I often played this on turn 3 and was sitting pretty against most anything AND had enough for another 5 mana spell next turn (Grasp and Wail).

The nerf to the actual spiders deck is a sad casualty though :(.",-1
"Well, you tried LMAO.",1
Vlad decks are generally slow value burn decks. Drain actually does help them a decent amount.,1
"Eh take heart is a bit more fair, since it requires some setup for its condition and that alone makes it harder to use. You need to run either self damage, or have it interact with the board, so it’s not as easy to pull off.",-1
"honestly i want my opponent to stay the fuck out of my deck. literally half the games i play against a Pilfered Goods ends with them playing a will of ionia on my unit as a B/ PZ deck or once even pulling my single copy of ruination to boardwipe me on opening next round and then swing to win with free sea monsters.  


The card is degenerate by nature and i think the only reasonable fix is to make it draw from the opponents graveyard instead. This limits it's insane advantage which, because you have no idea what they draw from YOUR deck, essentially putting you at a potential 4 region to 2 situation. Which creates so manny issues with prediction and counterplay when they can pull some complete bullshit out of their ass that shouldn't have even been possible.  


Also, drawing from the graveyard also fits the theme of the card.",-1
"They’re probably still in the collecting data phase, but interesting that NO Bilgewater cards got adjustments.",0
"Ok, so I love new Vlad.

Shen is a bit meh. Ok, now is not garbage but his level up ability is just so bad. I think maybe they should change it.

The other changes are OK. 

The nerf to karma I don´t know if it would change something.

And I am not so sure about the change to legion reguard. That card was not the problem. He wasn´t even a good 1 drop. It was the archetype. 

And I have some mixed feeling with brood awakening, at 5 mana it was so good, but as we all know 6 mana is not good enough. Maybe they could have changed the text instead. I don´t know.

We will see how the meta will develop, but I think control and combo deck will be the most powerful decks this patch",1
"One key problem with unyielding spirit is it the fact it persistently blocks your strongest units for the rest of the game INCLUDING all overwhelming damage. 

Even if champions can't receive it, cards like [Radiant Guardian](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Radiant_Guardian_%28Legends_of_Runeterra%29?file=01DE015.png)provide 5 lifesteal & counter your strongest units for the rest of the game.

As a burst spell, no other card in the game has that kind of power. Even the most powerful units at least give the opponent a chance to respond.",1
haha funny post,1
"I agree the changes are impactful, but I'll need to see burn in action. Demolitionist, Crimson Disciple, and Noxian Fervor are untouched, so they do still have some very strong potential.",1
? How would him attacking not be killing the nexus?,0
"Well, US and barrier prevent damage the unit should take.

If the unit has 8 health and the enemy 10 power with overwhelm, your unit should take 8, the Nexus 2.

US/Barrier prevent the 8 damage your unit should have taken",-1
Does Single Combat on Garen and some enemy that's not blocking him level him up?,-1
"Oof, yea, i think that's the death knell for it. It's a shame - that deck was pretty fun to play and wasn't exactly oppressive in the meta. Oh well.",1
Noxian fervor too,0
"Its actually a very big downside because Teemo is much less value than Rearguard and Boomcrew can do less attacks now and be removed quicker.

Im saying this specific deck is out. If you modify it, then yes, Im not saying aggro burn isnt viable.",0
He was 3 power before but was nerfed to 2. Glad they're revisiting this decision.,1
"Tfw moment after patch hit I match with burn aggro, he plays a [[Boomcrew Rookie]] into my [[Ruthless Raider]] turn 2 and immediately concedes.  
The joy felt cannot be described.",1
WHERE ARE THEY ?????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"I think, putting Karma on a board means you have something to save her as well or you could pass with 5 mana until the opponent uses the mana to not have any option to kill yours.

Now you have one less mana to save her and you need one more mana to put her into the field. This is huge imho but we will see.",1
He may thought It was 6 mana I guess...,0
so some things dont change in every riot games,-1
"I was thinking the same thing with the Neutral cards. I come from MTG, one thing to know about this game is it is definitely meant to be quick.",1
"Na. People imo play Shrooms wrong. Competitive Shroom decks are more of a Control archetype than an Aggro/Burn archetype.

Or support for Sejuani.",1
"in addition to below, refund only work if you never used the card you created/bought, but if you had used it even for 1 battle then it's not refundable anymore

&#x200B;

yes, I think lux/karma will take a hit, nerf in bear and meditation are quite big, but unyielding spirit still not getting nerfed and karma still ridiculously good anyway in late game, so they may still find a way",1
The problem is more that there currently doesn't exist an 1 mana aggro champ in those regions. It probably would've been included in it if it existed.,0
Is it still there??,0
"I like the rearguard nerf. It's gives every region a chance to defend turn 1. Now hawk can block it, SI 1/1 death cry cards can block it and most importantly it can be removed by Thermo beam on turn 1vs piltover control decks.

Similarly boomcrew can now be blocked by many 2 mana cards such as hard casting claws of the Dragon or even a turn 2 Thermo beam.

Good nerfs overall. Excited to see what the meta brings",-1
"I agree that rearguard didn't need a nerf. Any deck with noxus that used him and had not saboteur now probably has to replace him with saboteur. Both can deal 3 damage in turn 1, but saboteur actually can also block. The only upside of rearguard is now, he can trade into 3 health units.",-1
"They said something about 24 hours from yesterday when they ""released"" the patch.  It was bad communication for sure.  I think that 24 hours brings us to about 2:00 EST or 11:00 PST.  I am hoping for sooner though since I have a few mins to play and I'm not touching ranked until the meta decks are nerfed.",1
"That, or change it to a fast spell instead of a burst spell.",0
"Whoops... They do go hand on hand, because ranger grants a badgerbear theyre balancing around that. It would be better if the vanilla badgerbear stayed at 4/4, which seemed strong but not op, while the ranger spawned a 3/4.",1
"Keep it burst speed but make it not permanent and lower its cost significantly. It is still better than Riposte as invulnerability is a lot stronger than barrier. It could combo on a turn with cards such as single combat, etc.

Out of curiosity are Heimer and Will being looked at? As other decks go down Heimer is going to take over. Assuming US is nerfed Will could be lowered to 3 cost and make it hit followers only.",1
"Was going to say, in reality it’s a buff to Heimerdinger. It’ll still be strong in Lee Sin decks but comps that just run it without building around it should suffer a bit.",-1
"I was thinking it should last for 3-4 instances of damage. Or, it instantly revives and fully heals you once upon dying.

The way it is right now is making me want to auto-surrender against Demacia if I’m not playing Ionia (especially if they put it on Radiant Guardian)",0
"FUCKING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS ENTIRE PATCH!!!!!! I FUCKING LOVE YOU GUYS FOR THIS!!!!! DEAR GOD I LOVE YOU!

I'm sorry for the caps, but they adjusted so much of what I had been getting downvoted to shit for finding  annoying. All I need now is a little more healing for everyone besides shadow isles and Ionia",1
"Karma nerf is huge -- if Karma dies at any point in the game, enemy will have to wait 1 turn before playing her again. That is a  big window of opportunity",1
by far,0
"I know exactly how good it is. I also know that it's entirely dependent on black market merchant to really kick into overdrive.

No Ionian deck runs without deep meditation. The entire deep archetype runs without pilfered goods.",0
"In the end it's always trading a resource for another and what you may get for ""doing X or Y""... and I talked about those Demacia cards as a way to mention you could still protect the target of US if it was made fast.

I also agree 8 mana feels like a ""lot"" to spend on a spell but don't forget what it grants you, the ""value"" is huge! and I agree as well that making the card slow is a huge no, it would kill it or would limit its play way too much... but keep in mind that vengeance also grants you a lot of value and it only costs 1 less and it's fast, but i's effect isn't as ""permanent"" as the one from US. 

And keep in mind that some of the decks that use US are Fiora/Zed and Karma/Lux and in the last one you usually use it at turn 10 (or sometimes earlier) on one of your champs to freely upgrade her or to get a free Final Spark, so in those decks you may be able to use a Deny to save the target.",1
"In this particular scenario, the card can be so frustrating to play against I believe it would be better to just straight up nerf it into meme status and then buff it back up over time until it becomes playable again.

---

Even then, I believe the nice compromise would be to nerf the effect to only last 1 turn, but reduce the cost to 4 mana.

This way, the card would most certaintly see at least experimentation, as it would compete with Riposte or Spirit Blade for the spot in the decks that like Barriers. It'd offer better protection against direct damage, and still hard counter vengeance, at the cost of being able to trade into bigger units (+3 attack from Riposte) or Lifesteal (from Spirit Blade)",1
"I mean, the standard deep decks already uses life gain (grasp, wail, and the 3/2 that heals and tosses 3). The problem with consistency comes from the fact that you NEED tossers first, then you don't want to draw them at all, and there's nothing that can help you if the opposite happens (you don't draw tossers, or you don't draw sea monsters later). There was one duel I had for example where I didn't draw ANY sea monster, except nautilus, in the whole match, making it impossible to win even though I had deep for a while. And there was another distinct one where the opposite happened: Even though I mulliganed for it, I got almost no tossers, to the point I reached deep way too late and lost.  
  
Ultimately, albeit a strong deck when it pops off, depending on drawing cards in a specific order takes away consistency from it to the point it gets to rank 2 rather than 1.5 in my opinion. If the deck had more cheap draw options other than the toss 2 draw 2 that costs 4 mana, then yeah it would very easily be 1.5 since a higher draw helps combat inconsistency. But as it is right now, I feel the deck is only tier 2 sadly.",1
"I don't think so about your  I don't think so

3 mana for 4/4 body is insane tempo and value for the curve,  even more for a 4 mana that spawns 4/1 scout with 4/4 body after it died",-1
Or maybe everything that's OP should be tweaked a little bit lol. I don't like burn or Karma decks.,0
"yes, but there's wild cards, and the whole premises of getting a refund for your card in hearthstone, is that you can craft another of the same rarity",0
"Because I play Hecarim, they did it specifically for me. Thanks Rito.",1
"i can agree going slow is a bit much though

if you dont stop it ahead of time the only counter is ionia recall i believe.

even at 8 mana fast would still be fairly strong",1
The secret is that not even Riot wants you to play Teemo.,1
"Mobile player as well, having the same issue along with a massive lag during choices, taking up to 30 seconds for cards to load along with a lot of other laggy places that weren't before the maintenance. Runnin in an Asus Max Pro, and noticing that the game became worse in multiple places after maintenance",-1
"‪Love the changes!  Maybe for pilfered goods you receive a copy of your opponents card instead of stealing the actual card.  This would be interesting because each player might find different value out of the same card.  It doesn’t ruin the built deck and it adds value to the pilferer.  I realize you’d have to change some lingo, but you’rep still stealing.  ‬",-1
"why do people pigeon hole themselves into a very one way of thinking about cards?  If you got him very early on, hes very good for early game pressure",0
"There genuinely seems to be some kind of weird hive mind movement, particularly on this subreddit, where literally any post that calls out netdecking is rejected and downvoted into the abyss immediately.  


I genuinely worry about the current state of gaming due to stuff like this and gun guide tutorial videos and the like. They reduce the 'game' down to a mechanical operation. a task to be completed for a reward of dopamine for clicking the correct buttons with the 'correct' equipment (deck) to get that dopamine hit. People like Swim and Mogwai are just trying to make a living playing a game they love but the culture around gaming is turning this into a skinner box and i for one find it deeply troubling as more and more gambling mechanics are introduced into our lives and gamification of negative stimulus becomes more present.  


Also this game does a fantastic job of feeding you cards to build new decks so it's not like you need to be worried about lacking resources anyway.",-1
It's already pretty sad that a whole region relies on a tiny bird to keep it somewhat playable.,0
"Thank you, It looks familiar now. Now I want a sweating emote that resembles the sweating scene in Airplane!.",1
"According to Mobalytics, I/D has positive win % over SI/B.",1
Is there an exact date of when this patch is available ingame?,0
Good,1
At least from what they are saying it looks like there might be some adjustment to how card stealing works in the future?,0
Solid job all around they didn't murder any deck ! All I can say is thank God they don't listen to this sub lmao,1
"That argument kind of contradicts itself though because buffing cards instead of nerfing cards leads to less interactivity and fun. 

When the card pool is a lot stronger, in game choices tend to matter a lot less than the order in which you draw your cards (which is determined by RNG). And when a CCG gets to the point where RNG renders in game decision making unimportant, the game becomes a lot less fun.",1
Shit they got him.,-1
At least they mentioned it’s on a watchlist. Honestly I just think it needs to become fast.,1
No because there's no card dusting here...,-1
"He deserved a buff, I just wish it was defensive instead, like regen or tough.  He's the only support champion so far, they should have leaned into that some more.",1
"Wasn’t expecting Brood Awakening to get hit along with Rearguard. Spider Aggro is on life support.

We may be down to Burn Aggro and Scouts as the only two somewhat playable aggro decks.",1
Greathorn buff helps Remembrance. Now it's guaranteed to pull a 5 power follower (and potentially on turn 3).,1
"That's going to turn a lot of people off. Say what you will about Hearthstone, but when they make even a tiny nerf to a card, you get a full refund and you get to keep the card.

EDIT: I was thinking about when the HoF cards, not nerf. But still, offering the chance for a full refund is still a nice touch.",1
It gave more power to specialists if anything and more importance on lane control since towers had ammo.,1
"I would suggest to rework the card into giving permanent last breath effect to revive champion/follower at the beginning of the turn. The card would still be strong, but would be much easier to deal with.",1
Okay. Thanks a lot.,1
Did they fix the bug where shadowhshift doesn’t count as a recall? I didn’t see it.,0
The matching summoner icon fix is also MASSIVE,0
"> I am happy with this patch.

As Karma/Lux player i am not.    

It is not the Karma change nor deep meditation nor badger bear nor grizzle but the stand alone change. I dont like eye and emerald/stand alone was a great alternative but now i am forced into eye because burn will stay strong at the top unless people go extremly heavily into bilgewater/freljord/shadow isle.",1
"Brood Awakening and Deep Meditation definitely needed to be adjusted and they had clear and easy fixes.

Unyielding Spirit clearly needs a fix but it's not clear how to fix it without effectively nuking it out of existence. There just aren't a lot of ""tuning"" changes that don't end with the card being unplayable. Moving it to fast or upping the mana cost are both nerfs that probably see it drop out of the metagame.

Since Unyielding isn't causing wide spread game play health issues it was better to wait a patch to give them time to figure out a good fix instead of just going with a nerf that might not be for the best in the long term.

The card needs more work then ""change some basic things"" and so they're taking their time to find the right solution.",1
"The value/benefit of US is still fine for a 8 cost card at fast speed and even if you see a 40% resolve that's also a good number considering what you might get from it! And if doesn't resolve you still have other cards in your deck that you'll still be able to use (specially in control decks).

As for Vengeance what I was trying to say is that the card also costs tons of mana but still has some ways to play ""around it"" or ""diminish"" its effectiveness, it's a resource that gets ""used"" and that's it. US on the other hand ""lasts"" till you win or lose the game if you're not Ionia or Demacia.

And I actually agree with your numbers... but I also think the card should not be ""super strong"" or ""super easy"" to use. It should find a niche and have some kind of decent counter play for its effect. It needs more drawbacks than just being ""fast"", the effect is just too much. If they lower the cost and change it to fast I'm sure every deck that has Demacia will at least have one copy because ""it's just too good to miss it up"" and it will force your opponent to use resources on it... and not to even mention its effect is so conflictive that it may limit the type of cards for future expansions.",1
"Burn is absolutely shit though, and is heavily influencing what can and can't be played...

This is my first time playing a card game, and after getting matched over and over and over with burn, I just said fuck it and started playing it myself.

Went from Iron 4 at launch to Diamond 4 just yesterday.

You should not be able to get Diamond in 3.5 weeks in a game and genre you're playing for the first time.

I guess you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain...",0
"I dont agree with the whole burst thing, but I feel like some cards need to be more towards units the champions, some cards are unstoppable with those like fiora",1
Apparently you might get the update tomorrow or something I think,0
It'd be funny to see someone big-brain a Vlad + Neverglade Collector kamikaze swarm meme deck.,1
What if they made it so it only works on damaged units?,-1
"It was actually just a joke, man, because the change on Shen was kinda lame imo, he still doesn't got anything new with rising tides and I don't think it will see play just because it got +1 attack. And I totally forgot hecarim lol thanks for correcting me on this one.",1
"You guys are right, another suggestion i saw is 3/1 overwhelm which sounds much better",0
Is this also your first time seeing a joke?,0
"Yep, and if you create 2 ephemeral copies you get 3 spells that turn.",1
"A 1-Attack buff is definitely significant, especially if it means Hecarim can trade up against many 5-drops like Garen, the newly-nerfed Vi (that's a big help for Hecarim), and Gangplank.

It's just ""good"" to have a change like that, and its full effects won't be seen until we see it in practice, especially in conjunction with all the other balance changes made. While I'm not convinced Hecarim will see play, a 1-Attack buff is nothing to scoff at.

Just like a 1-Health buff would be nothing to scoff it - and he was nerfed from 6 Health for a reason.",1
"Eh, the game has several 1-drops that can represent a ton of value. Cithria, Tracker, Aristocrat, Omen Hawk...

Rearguard was good at one thing and one thing only. Now it's worse than another card in its own region.",0
"I disagree with the double dip nerf on Rookie and Rearguard. Burn Aggro is such a 'knife-edge' style of play that it really doesn't take much to put it way below the power line.

Pilfered Goods getting overlooked for now is also a big question mark for me. 2 Mana draw 2 is pretty crazy strong, not to mention the frustration factor as well as the potential for perfect steals.

No one deliberately puts bad cards in their deck, but Pilfered Goods' design acts as though it's a likely possibility that it'll pull something that the player can't use, which simply isn't the case.",0
"Until another region gets access to cheap Barriers, Shen will remain linked to Demacia (imo). Demacia has all the cheap Barriers (Brightsteel Protector and Prismatic Barrier). The cheapest immediately useful Barrier in Ionia is ~~Soul Reforged~~[[Spirit's Refuge]].",1
"Oh shit, that's true tbh haha. Just make him 6 cost, it'll be right. Lol jk",1
ya i never stopped useing then in my burn..  no champ version did't feel right.,1
"Glad to see the LoR balancing team understands burn aggro doesnt need to be destroyed, called the boomcrew nerf too, 1/4 > 1/3 is a very elegant nerf that makes it get into range of a lot of things without destroying the card, same for the rearguard, strong starting aggro, but now every used 1 drop can trade with it.",1
"Vlad Deck Main here. The buff to Vlad isn’t as impactful as I wanted it to be. His board presence is still invisible and his attack skill is still easily answered (killing minions, deny, recall) with such a big risk for little reward (you’re open attacking) with a drain that maxes out at 5. Crimson awakener still does a better job in proccing skills as it procs as he arrives. I’ll be testing him out more to see how it feels but with how I play crimson decks, I don’t think I’ll be returning him back in.

They’re pushing a very specific Vlad playstyle with freljord ramp. Freljord just has too few tools right now.

Whatever Vlad brings to the table other champions can still do better. If other decks are built around one champion, Vlad is still a support champion and will be looking into another buff or a rework in a future patch.",1
"**Versus A.I with some Normal player's thoughts on the patch:**

Vlad - As someone who runs him in Frejlord this will be big.  That combination lacks health gain and this change along with Tavernkeeper goes a long way to shoring up weaknesses.  That said, Vlad struggles with his self minion damage considerably.  I don't think this makes him a good champion at all.  I think it just makes one version of the deck slightly stronger as a tier 3 choice.  IMO Vlad requires something drastic like being unable to reduce friendly minions health below 1.

Karma - I'll admit...never enjoyed the play style of this champion.  I'm simply not qualified to talk about this nerf.  On paper it seems like almost nothing...she was often dropped on turn 9 or 10 backed up by protection spells already.  I honestly don't see how this one mana change has a real impact on her use.

Shen - Well that buff was unexpected.  He trades better but that was never his problem.  I can't possibly see how this bumps him up in the champion power ranking much at all.  I welcome the change.  I'd rather things be tuned slightly than over tuned.  But I could definitely see another buff to Shen in the future.  This change makes me want to run him in exactly the same decks I did before and nothing more.

Vi - Much needed nerf as she was way to universally good.  This change is HUGE as she now trades with plenty of 5 drop stat lines.  Great stuff.

Hecarim - Meh.  I was still using him post nerf unlike most.  If I had to buff him I'd have preferred to see level requirement reduced to 6 since that 7th minion is a almost always a problem.

Greathorn Companion - This card is scary.  If summoned off of remembrance turn 3 this thing will feel a lot like those ultra powered stand alone minions did before.  I trust this was well tested though so hopefully its not overpowered.

Grizzled Ranger / Badgerbear - Great.  Both changes are fantastic.  I still plan to run both cards together...that's a sign of a wonderful balance change.

Luarent Chevalier - Solid draw power and removal in one.  This was always a compelling card and now the buff ensures its pretty reliable at its role.   This could be tough to fit in decks...but there's no denying its a strong 4 drop option now.

Stand Alone - Awesome change.   Exactly what I wanted.

Legion Rearguard - Not needed.  Probably not a popular opinion but this was an easy minion to deal with and had plenty of downsides to balance its buffed stat line out.  I feel this was a bad choice to hit if your goal was to weaken aggro decks.

Kindly Tavernkeeper - Frejlord badly needed this.  I was running the old version for a while but eventually moved on because 2 power sucks on turn 3 or later.  Love the change.  Not even remotely overpowered either.

Deep Mediation - Great change.  RIP the 2 drop synergy group of cards though...that concept should get a buff or overhaul in the next patch.

Boomcrew Rookie - Unlike reargard I felt this card actually deserved a nerf and the change they made was the one I was hoping to see.  Good stuff.

Brood Awakening - BOO!  Look...I get it.  But this card found some nice play in more casual fun concepts like Elise Spiders/Kalista/Thresh and Prankster strategies.  I appreciate the idea of weakening control decks but I'd have chosen a card that didn't help enable a lot of tier 3/fun decks.

Longtooth - Glad to see this change considering Laurent Chevalier's....I don't think this makes Chum the Waters competitive viable but a buff to fizz is welcome as I feel that champion needed help.

Monkey Idol - No more sitting on the shelf for you...I'm actually going to try this now.

Slotbot - Hearthstone levels of bad RNG.  I don't want this card in LoR to begin with so I can only hope the buff doesn't make this card competitive viable.  I doubt it will....but either way I feel it needed a complete conceptual rework.

Note:  Unyielding Spirit - I'm genuinely surprised this card got a pass (for now).  It seems to create far more value than your typical 8 drop minion let alone spell.",1
My main deck since the beginning is Vlad Braum with crimson and health spells. I think it just got much better.,1

"I think this change would make a lot of sense. Freijoid players still need to play around this mechanic, but at least they won't have their win-condition got robbed if the mechanic changed to this direction. Also, they could do some increase-cost to force these cards into dedicated Plunder decks instead of letting them be that generalists.",1

The feeling - u know- when u try what ever tf deck u find fun enough and creative and u love its concept then -boom- 3 damn no champ aggro matches in a row.

The problems of them are they dont even need to hit ur nexus with unit, not even a single damn time, and still fk u up. 

The games with aggro are the aggro players game, when u try to catch up with the straight to face dmg ( wishing to draw a healing cards if u from SI) or to simply accept ur fate if u dont put anything down in 2 turn",1
Dunno why this is being downvoted lol,1
I still believe that it is good as it is. There should be cards to keep things like unyielding in check and a lot of times it is a dead card,0
"We have two 2/2 for 1 with an upside, 3/2 for 1 with a big downside was Fine. The real issue with the deck is the absurd amount of reach it has.

"I've been playing alot of ephemerals. The deck was a bit weak, imo.

I think the extra power could have been out somewhere else, but I don't think he's too strong.",1
I'm fine with the Boomcrew Rookie nerf but hitting Rearguard as well was too much. There's no point in playing him anymore.,1
"The best self-harm units are Vrynna and the Disciple because they dodge blockers with their Overwhelm/effect. The 1 mana 0/3 and 3 mana 2/4 are pretty mediocre as they just get blocked forever. I think some more self-harm units need either Overwhelm or Regeneration, so their effect has more meaning to it.

Hecarim looks to be decent yes, its just Ephemeral itself thats pretty bad. The problem is that they lack good defense while their offensive doesn't make it up for it. They can ignore your Ephemeral units and then just open attack into your non-existent board. There needs to be an Ephemeral version of The Undying, a weak-ish unit that always dies and revives every round to have a permanent board-body. And yes, Black Spear needs a buff.",1
"I was honestly not expecting new emotes and cosmetics this patch. So new emotes means new changes to the emote meta:

New additions:

1. Draven ""Clutch!!!"" or ""Take that you poozer!!""
2. Ezreal ""Sweating buckets"" or ""Ah fuck, I can't believe you done this""
3. Elise ""Look at this BMing fool"" or ""YOHOHOHOHOHOHO""
4. Teemo ""Please give me a mystic shot so I can kill the 2 health nexus before this guy erases my fucking existence"" or ""Let's hope I won't need that Ledros I shuffled back into the deck later.""
5. Rainbow Poro ""Hooray! my Strat worked"" or ""Get Fucked \*confetti\*""

Opinion:

1. Draven: an emote that has very supplementary use and can only be used sparingly, but can still hit hard when need be. 6/10
2. Ezreal: pure meme, can only be used to justify the opponent's sick, toxic plays. But as an alternative can be used with close friends to compliment their sick plays....pfff LIKE THAT'LL EVER HAPPEN!!! 4/10
3. Elise: an emote to show your weeb superiority, as well as a response to a roping, BMing jackass; an emote with plenty of toxic uses. 8/10
4. Teemo: Like Ezereal, it is mainly an emote to stroke your enemy's ego or state how desperate you are, can be used as a bluff as well as plenty of plunder and TF decks so it has a little extra use. 5-6/10
5. Rainbow Poro: A blander emote with some toxic appeal and not much else, but it's free soooooo....ehh. 7/10

Of course the meta has been upset before because of new additions. Vlad ""Cheers"" has been quite popular since its release, so who knows? Is anyone else more experienced in the Emote meta?",1
And it can be stronger coz the 2 worst matchups: Burn aggro and Midrange demacia get nerfed,-1

"Aggro is dead. Say welcome to the midrange and control fiesta.

Edited TL;DR: Burn Aggro was strong but it was a shitty deck. It was the only aggro deck in the meta because unit centered aggro cards are shit. Now they nerfed burn, hence no aggro at all in the next patch.

Aggro cards suck in this game and they just made them worse. You know why burn was the unique aggro deck in the game? Because all the other aggro cards suck so much, especially units, that the ones that got played were the ones who dealt damage to face. Boomcrew Rookie wasn't overpowered in Discard Aggro, why would it be now?

Aggro lacks quality one drops because all of them die to a mere 1/1 owl that gives value as soon as it hits the board. That's why Rearguard was good, and they just nerfed it.

The other two one drops -- the spider and the lady -- are fucking awful and are just played because there's nothing better to fill the slot. They pale in comparison of the two 2/2, the 2/1 bird, and the aristocrat.

The one drops are so bad they need to make other cards strong just to make the aggro playable -- Boomcrew and the new 2/3 are good cards. Everything else is decent (Grenadier, Crimson girl). The burn spells are good, I'll give you that.

Really sad to see aggro to away like this. Aggro burn was a coin flip on its own, now there's no aggro at all.",-1
Anything that doesn’t win in 6 rounds loses to control. You’re basically just saying “aggro shouldn’t be allowed in the meta” and that removes the rock-paper-scissors nature of card games and that isn’t healthy for the game at all. Aggro decks are SUPPOSED to exist.,1
"As a Yasuo simp, I approve of this. Good suggestions. 
The pseudo entreat might need to be tweaked a bit since casting it means you are paying effectually 7mana for a 4.4(or 5.5) that is very easy to remove while being the one card that makes the deck useful for more than stalling.",1

"Everyone else: good.  
It's totally understandable to want to play a deck that you can race your opponent with, and there is definitely a space in the meta to allow that, but when burn becomes completely non-interactive and warps the entire meta to be heal, burn, or lose in 5 turns that deck needs to go. It's the reason elusive and fearsome decks got the axe, it's the reason unbreakable and Ezreal will probably see a change next patch. There will still be a space for burn, you can still play rearguard on a good turn 1 and get the full 3 damage out, you can still play rookie and get 2 face damage with a body, but there is no reason those cards needed to out trade their mana comparable cards in other regions than to prop up burn.",-1
Yeah that nerf seems a bit heavy-handed. I can't imagine it will be used much anymore,0

This is terrible logic.  Card power level in a vacuum doesn't matter, what matters is the context of the decks it's in and the metagame.  A card can be bad in one deck and overpowered in another, or it can be a very strong card that doesn't cause problems until it finds the right deck to take advantage of it.",0

"That's why I plan to play Vladimir with Garen.

They've both got decent bulk and are resilient board threats thanks to Regeneration. Garen rallies, which lets you attack consecutively with Vladimir. Bulky units also leverage Detain well, and Demacia's access to Tough through Bramble Vest and Ranger's Resolve, especially, provide immense value for Vladimir, who can then activate his ability without damaging his allies, Crimson units, and Legion Veteran.

If Garen doesn't work out, Katarina, Lucian, Relentless Pursuit, Tianna Crownguard, and Shunpo are other options to try.",1
"I agree that on paper, there is. But I never flipped her when piloting the deck, and I suspect she's just win-more at that point.

"Aggro by far had the best winrate and highest playrate.

Also, 2 mana 4 health follower is insane. You literally cannot kill it on turn two. I mean, seriously, tell me any way you can do 4 damage removal from 3 mana (assuming you floated it on turn 1). And blocking it does nothing since the damage comes from the effect, not the attack. So against decks that don't run a lot of removal, that's 4 damage guaranteed (attacks twice), no matter what. That's 20% of your health gone to a sticky follower that you MUST remove over followers with bigger attacks. It's busted to hell and back.",-1
"It really needs to be SLOW. It's way too strong to be Burst and it's honestly even too strong to be fast unless it was limited to one turn (and lowered in cost appropriately)

She's far to immortal against far too many decktypes at the moment once they get her buffed.",1

"Burn aggro was just flat out an overpowered deck, and I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up getting Get Excited nerfed. Riot already stated that it had disproportionately high winrates vs any favorable matchup. Aka anything except the other current S tier decks.

Corina's winrate is only because of burn aggro being simultaneously the strongest AND cheapest deck, thus pushing burn to the highest playrate (10% according to mobalytics. Next highest is 2.8%).

"Firstly, you're right, there are weird interactions. But that will eventually become a problem as more mechanics are involved. And see, the lifesteal thing I actually get.

In my example, the damage being dealt to something is stated to be ""prevented"". You'd assume that means that it's becoming a null value instead of ""damage is being done.

With the lifesteal thing, sure a spiderling can only take one damage. However, the unit doing 5 damage is still doing 5 damage. That damage just meets/exceeds the damage threshhold of a Spiderling and therefore kills it. It works the same in MTG, a unit will always deal its power as damage and you calculate off of that amount.

The issue here is that damage ""being prevented"" doesn't seem to act as such except as a stand-in for ""damage is still being dealt, but we covered it up"". Which leads to Unstoppable units dealing excess damage to the nexus as normal despite that damage being supposedly ""prevented"", the scar Clan units being able to buff infinitely without technically ever taking damage at all, again being ""prevented"", and probably other interactions that I am not thinking of right now.

Honestly, either the syntax needs to be clarified to state that yes, damage is still being done but it is specifically 0 and not ""damage prevented"". Or they need to fix interactions in-game.",-1
lol those two were predicted to be OP from the moment they were revealed. I wonder who even gave the ok to release them as they were?,1
">I also agree 8 mana feels like a ""lot"" to spend on a spell but don't forget what it grants you, the ""value"" is huge!

If it gets to resolve lol. I played around with Lee's signature spell. Even with deny back up I was only resolving about 40% of the time. Granted it was an OTK deck where it not resolving wasn't a game loss but the tempo loss did cost me several games.

Fact of the matter is while US at fast speed is much less vulnerable than Dragon's it is basically more expensive than EVERY SINGLE CARD that can disrupt it.

>but keep in mind that vengeance also grants you a lot of value and it  only costs 1 less and it's fast, but i's effect isn't as ""permanent"" as  the one from US.

What are you trying to argue here? I feel like I'm missing the point.

>And keep in mind that some of the decks that use US are Fiora/Zed and  Karma/Lux and in the last one you usually use it at turn 10 (or  sometimes earlier) on one of your champs to freely upgrade her or to get  a free Final Spark, so in those decks you may be able to use a Deny to  save the target.

I agree in control match ups you should wait for deny mana. In midrange not so much.

I feel like our only disagreement is that we think US will have different levels of disruptions in actual play.

I think at 8 mana (without deny) it will resolve maybe 50% of the time.

I think at 7 mana (without deny) it will resolve closer to 65% of the time.

I think at  6 mana (without deny) it will resolve closer 75% of the time.

8 with deny is closer to 40%

7 with deny is closer to 70%

6 with deny is closer 90%",1

"Again at fast speed I think it’s “fine” at 7 mana. I don’t think it would be played though.

I agree right now the card is free to play minus like will. Which means if I’m not playing Ionia I just play it on curve. I agree that it is “easy” in so far as it has a low level of decisioning making.

However it also is incredibly inflexible and costly. 8 mana is a big chunk of change on any turn.

If it was made slow the card would turn into Dusk and Dawn Pt 2 ( The worst of the twilight spinoffs if you ask me) a incredibly degenerate card that is either a meme or broken depending on the match up.

I think that’s the thing that should be on the watch list.

The only real thing I disagree with you on is the deny thing. Sure you could play it in a slow combo control deck with like Vi or something. THEN I would wait on deny mana.

But in its current version played you would not wait for deny back up even if you play Vi in the list.

Just as a note I always use Single Combat as my standard for removal since it’s the most “balanced” removal in the game.

So when you say Prismatic or etc can save it all I think that free mana uptrading.",1

"Overall I think this is a very good patch, with only one point that I strongly disagree with. 

 I don't think Deep Mediation should have been nerfed. Instead, other regions should get better draw options. 

The reason Deep Meditation is strong is because it is a good draw spell (that only draws spells, which is better than just 2 draw) with the potential to be cost-reduced. 

However, card draw being strong is a good thing. Adding card-draw cards to your deck increases the consistency of the deck, resulting in lower highrolls and higher lowrolls. This increases the effect of player skill on the outcomes of matches and decreases the effect of draw RNG. This is what we should be aiming for, and what Riot advertised this game as (win on skill not luck).

Therefore, in the interest of making the game more skill-based and less luck-based, if Deep Meditation is overperforming, we should increase the draw capability of regions other than Ionia rather than nerf Deep Meditation.",1

Honestly, it's not that interesting even for a common card. You either have it or you don't. You drop it on the board when you have mana and you always attack with it. It having can't block just makes it even more brain-dead on defense compared to the other aggro 1 drops

"agreed on Rearguard not being as bad as, say, disciple + demolitionist, but i'm thinking they touched rearguard specifically bc it only hurts aggro decks, whereas self-harm decks or some slow swain list, which have trouble even existing as it is, would be that much worse off if they don't have their ""op"" tools to justify going out of your way to run the archetype. 

whether or not the rearguard + boomcrew nerfs are ""enough"" to keep burn in check is a different question that we'll just have to wait and see for, but if a turn 1 rearguard truly did create a crazy winrate differential in comparison to other individual cards in the typical list according their metrics, then maybe nerfing rearguard was the ""best"" way to achieve their outcome, with a tradeoff that the nerf isn't necessarily fair to rearguard itself.",-1

It's much, much easier to deal with Jinx on turn, say, 5, than a Stand Alone Zed on turn 3.

I do believe vlad will be a monster after the patch.",1
"tbh, what are YOU talking about

karma up to 6 is a huge nerf to that deck. it's now impossible to drop karma + two 4 mana spells on turn 10 with full spell mana, or karma + rememberance + single combat. not to mention, dropping karma prior to turn 10 is delayed by a whole turn if you wanna protect her with deny. and, there are a lot of spots where you love having mana left over for a healing potion. AND deep meds is worse now too. 

plus, even outside of wombo combo stuff, the beefy midrange units aspect of the deck is hit hard, bc the reason radiant guardian is so good is that grizzled ranger was really hard to not block, and really hard to not kill when you block it, which means it nearly guarantees a radiant proc on curve. now, ranger is more easily ignorable, and is less valuable as a forced sack via single combat

i still think there's a good chance for lux karma to be viable, but i'm not really sure what you're seeing in the patch that's so ""incredible"" for it. it's not like burn aggro was oppressing lux+karma so hard that you can't ladder with it currently

to be fair tho, unyielding spirit is still crazy, perhaps even crazier",1
"Atleast they should allow him to block, he had that cause he was overstated for a 1 mana, but that aint the case anymore",0
"I wanted the answer, but this isn't the one I wanted. Thanks.",1
You can’t pilfer champions.,1
There is no difference between your opponent stealing a card and this card being on bottom of your deck. If your deck can't win without drawing your fun and interactive Unfuning Spirit or whatever is your win condition then you have a flawed deck and no crying about Pilfer cards will not fix that,-1
Every bad experience doesn't need a nerf.if you reduce all interesting decks to meme tier you kill combo and tempo. The suggestions you made set up a world where everyone does their own thing and who does it first wins. That is not a game worth playing.,-1
yip,0
"Spider and discard aggro are fine, it's the burn variants that have massive play and win rates. Regardless, there is nothing wrong with them shifting some power away from the high play and win rate decks. It keeps things fresh. Otherwise you get what feels like a 'Dr Boom every single game' situation, and that's no fun for anyone.",1
When did I say the nerf was bad? I have been playing Vi/Ezreal. Just didn't expect Riot to go this hard on all the tier 1 decks. I was expecting more buffs than nerfs.,0
I never understand when the patch become active,1
"I get it but the first attack each turn would still be elusive. Plus you get 10 shrooms on turn 1. A simple 1/2 Teemo would be fine. Survives thermo beam, vile feast, statik shock, wail, etc. At Lvl 2 he would survive mystic shots and 2/1 saplings.",-1
"I know, I'm saying the buffs were good on her, but they wouldn't really flip. Garen couldn't challenge them but he could at least attack into them once buffed, and flip far more easily.",0
Yeah this is the real answer. They just won't run that card anymore.,0
"I actually played it and i think it's quite balanced already. I used a Teemo/Karma deck and got 6 wins in a row. Also  I think Demacia is still good enough to be a nice top tier pick for expedition, the mana curve that gives you is so useful that these nerfs aren't enough.",1
"Grizzled Ranger was the best card in the game by a huge mile. It out-statted every 5 drop in the game, including Quinn. Everyone unanimously knew he was getting nerfed. The amazing part is how it took a month to nerf a card that shouldn't have even left QA.

With -2 attack, its still a great stat body, especially since he can still attack twice.

Being compared to Bull Elnuk is fine. Just because its Freljord, doesn't mean Bull Elnuk isn't still a big stat body. Yes, compared to Badgerbear, Bull Elnuk sucked. But Badgerbear was an overstatted powercreeped gargantuan.",1
"Shen was playable before rising tides, and I doubt it will se play again because of that +1 attack because it just doesn't matter much. About Vlad, as I said, maybe I'm wrong on that, but I do believe if people start messing with it they'll find a way to make it work. Now that it also heals you it opens a whole new perspective on vladmir decks.",-1
"Maybe, maybe not. The problem with nerfing Corina is that it's a deck that is more than the sum of its parts, all of the individual cards with the exception of Vi aren't really overtuned but all the parts just work so damn well together and I'm pretty sure it would've been meta even if the Aggro countering aspect wasn't there. 

I think there maybe was a case for changing (not necessarily nerfing) Withering Wail because it's very polarizing, either being meh to bad vs Midrange or an utter blowout vs Aggro.",0
"Yeah, I do agree, but if you use rally, then you can:

* Attack with Shen (+shield)

* scout attack

* attack 3rd time",-1
"Just read the ability ""life steal"".

You cannot steal more then anything there is present. The spiderling doesn't have 5 life to be stolen.",0
Drawing from the bottom would be a massive buff.,0
"yeah but those aren't generated by the card itself, unless it changed, battering ram also doesn't work with dawn and dusk, indicating that it doesn't carry over self buffs. Whether this is a programming mistake or intentional, I have no clue",-1
"Did the vlad drain buff not ship? Just played a match where Vlad did not drain, when I went into collections the card also doesn’t have drain on it.",0

I’m going back to Noxus.",-1
"Unyielding Spirit, even on Fiora, is not an auto-win. If your enemy wastes an entire turn to bank spell mana for this strategy then pressure them during the turn they spend doing literally nothing.",-1
promised? what? they said that were looking into it and then they explained here why they didn't touch him,1
"Definitely not. Will of Ionia is the biggest counter, the second is mid game pressure. The big swing turn comes from Naut, otherwise they play okay-ish expensive bodies which isn't overwhelming. Will just delays that turn and forces them to lose too much tempo while replaying Naut. 

Demacia also just runs down Deep mid game. Maybe that changes with the nerfs, but the minions Deep plays before they are Deep are pretty bad. However Demacia has no coming back once Deep does level up Naut.",0
"hence the label of ""rework""",0
"Both burn and Corina were better according to mobalytics, but I do see your point",0
"Then we should change the mecanic of Unyielding spirit, but a 4 mana for a better vengeance seems op to me. It's still discutable though.",1
"In a lot of situations you don't want to block with burn decks anyway so that's not that much of a disadvantage.   
Many decks don't have any turn 1 plays at all. Few have one that trades favorably into rearguard. So you get a lot of value out of that 1 mana play.",1
I have been playing the game for about two weeks and I really enjoy it. I honestly think this is an excellent game although there is still room for improvement obviously. I touched upon Unyielding Spirit in another comment but there is a full megathread about it so I won't talk about it here. I'm not sure this is the right place for a feedback like this (as you don't talk about this in the patch) but I feel like the daily reward system is a bit thin at the moment. Would it be possible to add other quests or just make the daily reward system overall more rewarding for players who play more than an hour per day? Is this something that you are considering?,1
"Yep!  That said, this game's support has tended to be extremely generous.  I wouldn't be surprised if someone crafted Vi just before the nerf announcement if support would honor a refund.  Probably worth the time to message them u/kheycee17",1
The Spooky version might be able to get around that via Mist's Call -- think we'll see it pop up in the metagame again? I'm a big fan of it ~~even though it keeps kicking my ass when I play~~ *~~against~~* ~~it.~~,0
"Im corina control main, and I really think this is a big change for vi (corina-control overall), specially brood awakening got nerf from 5 to 6 mana cost.",0
"And its still op imho, i was hoping for 4/3 body",1
"The patch is going out tomorrow, but won't be live until Wednesday morning I think",0
Then I hope it dosnt get nerfed just so that reddit gets overloaded and explodes xD,1
"Wouldn't worry about it, she's almost certainly still going to be played. Just not as universally good as she used to be.

Although if you haven't played with her yet, you should still be able to refund her by the way.",1
"sad that Vi got nerfed as quick as she did. Vlad buff is pretty interesting tho, ive actually been brainstorming a ""hurt yourself"" deck.",0
"Yea it was op but the nerf makes it pretty much unplayable. Almost every 1 drop will want to block this since a lot of the popular 1 drops value come from their play affect and against the aggressive decks this card would supposedly be played in taking these kind of trades is extremely worthwhile. 

I think they should have made it a 3/1 for 1 that can block, this way it is in line with the other keywordless 1 drop  cithria and has the potential to trade with a higher cost minion or block a fearsome unit. 

But as is a 3/1 can't block seems extremely useless",-1
Surprised to see this so low.  Imo Brood is not good anymore.  Pre bilgewater it was 6 mana and it wasnt used.,-1
That would work as well but it doesn't fit the current action structure of the game. There's not a trigger for start attacking player turn as far as I am aware,-1
"I think one of the biggest pros of this card is that right now you can be proactive and destroy your opponent with it. I mean, it's on the watch list for a reason! Specially because of its speed and its effect. And personally I think you should play this card as an answer or wait till it can be used safe, that's why adding ""fast"" to it would at least allow one more region to deal with it (SI) and others would have more tools to deal with it more constantly. Right now it's too ""easy to play"" and at 6 cost it would still be ""easy"" considering its strong effect.

If it was Fast and kept its cost SI would be able to use Vengeance, Grasp or Spear (if a target died) during the stack, which is something. Freljord still can't deal with that card constantly (at least now), it needs to Frostbite that card to ""survive it""... so perhaps making shatter fast would help? Bilgewater already ""can"" do something more permanent against it (which is tricky and require many ""ifs"" to work so it's not really reliable) but with keeping that cost and making it fast you could try to damage it somehow. PT&Z could do the needed damage to kill the target as well. Demacia (with Detain/Purify if it was cast on a minion) and Ionia (with Will of Ionia) can already ""counter it"" but with this they would have more tools now. Keep in mind the card needs to have some kind of drawback for it's effect, it's just too strong!

And regarding the ""you wouldn't play this with deny backup"" you're kinda wrong, since you could if you want to use it safely. And to save the target without Ionia you could also play a Prismatic Barrier, a Stand Alone, a Ranger's Resolve, Radiant Strike, Chain Vest, etc. if the enemy tried to ""damage it"" during the stack.. and all those cards are from Demacia!

Also you're right regarding Warmother's Call, but that one requires a LOT of investment to play and perhaps now that Burn/Aggro decks will be more on check more people will start using that card... and see how broken it is in reality. And if that happens they'll probably limit it somehow.",-1
"I just like a lot of the decks that happen to be meta, and it gives me a bit if bragging rights, although I still don't play more than 10 games every other day",0
All nerfs seem necessary but not overbearing. Good first patch.,-1
"It gets crossed up by 5 damage units now which is a huge deal. Midrange of all flavours even Yetis can smack her cheeks now and she is no longer flat out better than champions in their only strategy. Do you know how shit it feels that every champion unflipped would just get challenged and removed by vi? Anything with 5 attack or less got destroyed and you often mever had enough removal to take her thicc ass off the board. Due to her tough she could straight up just stop corina control from losing to board clears from Stuncall or Kegs. Don't even get me started on poor lil Lee Sin who got his lunch money taken. 

Welcome back into the game Barrier midrange, Yetis, Crimson, Stuncall, and Demacia Aggro.",-1
"Some damn good changes man. Real happy with vlad, vi, grizzled. Thank god for the brood awakening nerf too; felt like that card single Handedly pushed Elise over the edge since its buff.  Cautiously optimistic that Chum is a decent enough card now to provide some last resort pressure.",1
"thanks! I just got on this sub and found the deck today. I just wanted to confirm that the deck didn't go to total shit before I crafted 3x Vi.

Edit: Just noticed I posted my comment in a massively wrong post. Kudos to you for figuring what I meant.",0
At mid/high diamond sejuani+swain decks have become a very real thing and they are evil.,-1
"Well they made your key piece win condition 1 mana higher to cast, the refill is also 1 mana higher to cast (especially punishing if you can't proc the reduction when you need to fish for something) and your midgame got weakened, and unlike bannerman you rely on that to keep up with the board.

But sure, mine is just a prediction so i hope to be proved wrong.",1
"That works quite well. Pretty much all the dawn and dusk combos work from champions, and fiora will be killable. Maybe enemy followers as well, as I don't like it when cards limit it to just your units",1
"As someone who just crafted lux/karma and spent 14,000 dust, three champion wildcards, and most of my epic and rare wildcards, I'm severely dissapointed.",0
"The new answers to him are basically ANY 1 cost, 1 power units.

Trading Omen Hawk/Hapless Aristocrat/Spiderling/Mageseeker Investigator into that thing will feel a lot better nowadays.",1
"when exactly is the new patch going live? I'm confused, I thought it would go live on may 26 (yesterday) ?",-1
"Exactly, you can't play him if is not ready to level up, and with the current meta state playing too many ephemeral units in the first 4/5 turns will lose you the game... But since both demacia and noxus early game issues has been nerfed it might become a tier 2/3 deck.",-1
"yeah, but it's so easy to kill at least one of the three spiders, and usually, when your opponent plays brood, he won't have any mana to respond to a hypothetical removal",0
Brood awakening is hilarious. It went from 5 to 6 to 5 and now back to 6. Can't wait to see it in the next patch,1
"Saw the boomcrew rookie nerf coming but didn't expect a hit to rearguard too, but I'll take it. Vladimir looks way better with the buff, and I'm happy to see horse Boi get some love. +1 health instead of attack would've been even better, but maybe that would have been too good of a buff",1
Reconsider!,0
"It's RNG, but fair RNG. You're randomly distributing the same stats in a variety of ways, while Elnuks either gives you a few stats or an overwhelming amount of stats.",1
"Oh yeah, forgot the day changed when mobile came out",0
Bilgewater doesnt have Draven,0
If it will be fast speed it will probably need to move to 6-7 mana or maybe even 6 mana slow speed but it probably won't see nearly as much play which is I am guessing is your point.,1
"Tavernkeeper buff in the context of Braum / Vlad makes sense to me. The Brood Awakening nerf however feels like it doesn't fix the core problem with Corina, and people will simply find other stall tools to help Corina.

Vi nerf feels like removing a car's windows because it drives too fast: it doesn't fix the core issue and makes everything more uncomfortable as a result.

But I will admit I haven't seen Corina being run in forever. I've been desperately trying to get Vi to work in Vi / Heimer or Vi / Lee and she feels very hit-or-miss.",0
That's the change they are referring to that will make it unplayable.,0
"A 4/1 for one mana, though? Even without being a blocker, that is really scary.",-1
">not that good since game release

this is literally the first patch after game release...

(also fearsome aggro with a pretty big spider component was quite dominant in the previews)",1
Vi got nerfed down to 4 healths.,0
"If they gut aggro then karma is going to be an even bigger problem.  As soon as they nerf something, some other deck will be the top, the winrate numbers clearly show the game is pretty balanced right now as it is, then they're taking a chunk out of the top decks, not sure what you want.",1
"Alongside the nerf to meditation, it is totally enormous.

And while she was rarely played on curve (situation dependent), Karma regularly hit the board before turns 9 and 10, provided you could protect her. Her spell generation ramping up to the end of the game provided lots of value in the form of many more options to keep Karma decks' gameplan alive. Now that's going to be a lot more difficult.

I think she will still be a very valuable champion, but I think you'll see tempo and midrange decks win matches they wouldn't have in the past against Karma.",1
I think the chances of that key card being stolen is higher than it being at the bottom though.,-1
"Absolutely, i’ve run into this one a lot",0
Just SCOUTing for some FORTUNE in the form of upvotes.,0
But it would be played in a lux/karma deck,1
It specifically says if both players get interrupted. So just a server issue.,0
What is the bug?,0
"But in other hand that is 1 more free damage without damage your teammate, if they have barrier on.",0
"Damn, so there will be multiple ways to play against it? What a crazy idea.",-1
"In LOR, the game revolves around counterplay. To slam down a 3/2 on turn 1, it's hard for decks to remove. And the win rate when it's slammed on turn 1 shows. With a 1 health statline, it allows for counterplay. It could however be alittle too weak as other 1 drops are able to remove it. It either too overpowered or underpowered. With a 3/1, there are better cards to run. It has to do with spell based removals in the game. Think statik shock or vile feast, and grasp and get excited.",-1
"A lot of units have 5 attack but not 6. Also, two 3 attack units can kill her now. It's definitely going to be a solid hit to her winrate.

Whether it removes her from the universal goodstuff category remains to be seen, which is what their goal is.",-1
No deck would ever use this.,0
I just learned that Hecarim use to a be a 4/6 -> 5/7. It's what I always dreamed of. This will do though!,0
"The idea is with regular play, you should have a full collection 75% of the way through a set cycle. Personally, I hate nerf refunds as they affect how devs nerf. Hearthstone will try to nerf every card common and uncommon around a legend to avoid the market flooding with free dust from a nerfed legend. It leads to bad nerfs and killing innocent cards when a simple legend would have sufficed.",-1
"Do I misunderstand something with Vi?  
I had her on 10 strength (since I played 8 cards while she was on my hand), I played her, and attacked the opponent Vi, my Vi survived as the opponent's only had 2 strength. So, shouldn't that level up my Vi? Since she successfully attacked while having 10 strength? She didn't level up at all, I tried attacking and killing a unit successfully the following round again and still nothing happened. What do I misunderstand?",1
And rookie ;),0
"I've had some decent success pairing him with Lee Sin. Put in Sonic Wave, Retreat, Eye of the Dragon, Concussive Strike, whatever else Ionia you want, and finish it off with Noxus for things like Arachnoid Sentry, Legion General, and Minotaur Reckoner.",1

"Oh boy, vlad is gonna everywhere soon",0
Yea I have been looking into something with Vlad and Garen or Braum. Should be interesting,1

"They generally dont destroy cards, they make small nerfs",1
"Crimson awakener is good if you have a cursed keeper on board with any crimson units. Big 5/5 body on 4 is worth the tradeoff, especially if you get value out of it by getting a 4/4 or more crimson units in hand. Skitterer is a solid defensive option that can survive a vlad drain as well.",1

Make a support ticket,1
"Can you link me to some of these as an example of what you are talking about? 

But I'm guessing it's not Riot worshiping specifically but maybe people don't agree with the posters idea of balance. For example I saw a guy say rearguard should have been a 4/1 instead of a 3/1 and I downvoted him. By not downvoting him wouldn't mean that I hate Riots approach to balancing tho. It doesn't need a correlation.

It just means I specifically hated that guys idea.

I didn't really think about that. But I don't see it being too big of a contender in Freljord decks as opposed to other heavy hitting cards. And in every other way and in every other deck, it is now stronger.",0
Oh ok ty,1

No 1 drop should be able to trade with 2 cards",-1
"I think the Vlad change is bigger then it looks first. Vlad decks are bad because they play ""fair"" with units without burst damage or heal. Most of the times I encountered a Vlad deck I won because they were low and I somehow bypassed there units (PnZ, Atrocity, Elsuives, etc.)

Now Vlad doesn't let you play an unfair game because you either pull a 20-0 Ezreal turn or he will heal everything back slowly and you should go through the followers which will be hard.

The question is consistency which might shape my statement",0

Holy fck. You keep defending this broken shit card on every thread regarding US. How about you try to build a proper deck for once and not relying on a clearly broken piece of shit to get you out of Iron rank? I'm fine with riot just completely kill the card and toss it into the trash along with all the shitty players like you that are abusing it. I'm fine with burn deck since it at least requires some form of synergies and game plan. US is just an insta win card I don't know how it even gets into the game in the first place.,-1
"May i ask why?
I'm playing this game casually.",1
"Endure control was also a fairly cheap deck to start with, only 3 Elises needed, and you start the game with 2 I believe.",0
No there are no refunds for adjusted cards. They talked about this during the beta,-1
"In the beta you got a champion every time you did an expedition, but they change it and people still expect to get them",1
Play aggro decks and you'll start to notice how important rear guard is over time. The Runeterra isn't mistaken in pointing out that turn 1 rearguard significantly increases win rates. I love to play this card and hate to play against when I'm not playing aggro.,1

I hadn't really thought about it but I don't think I have seen Gangplank in a single non expedition matchup so far. Definitely seems like he needs a buff at that point..,1
"Overall great set of changes, including some of the most common suggestions from the players. I really like that they hit aggro, midrange and control options at the same time which should help to keep the balance between the different archetypes. 

Only the feelsbad as Freljord when facing steal decks is something they could have improved as well. Getting a buffed unit or Ashe arrow yoinked = undying rage. At least the tavernkeeper got buffed quite significantly. 

I also really like the approach of regular, sensible balance updates that reign in the outliers without completely destroying overperforming cards. Compared to this, the hearthstone dev team looks like bloody amateurs. Good job Rito, keep it up!",1
Really like how they implement more  [memes](https://quotesbae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweating-Man-Meme-Funny-Image-Photo-Joke-03.jpg),1
Freljord was bad before steal,-1
"I'm a massive fan of a vast majority of these changes (god I hated grizzled ranger and stand alone especially), but I don't entirely agree with the rearguard nerf. Sure, the card was pretty much an auto-include in noxus aggro decks, but it was pretty bad everywhere outside that, so it wasn't insane. Now that it loses 1 health I can't imagine it ever seeing play in any context really. I don't even think a vanilla 1 mana 3/1 would really see play due to how vulnerable it is to the massive plethora of pings in the game. I'd rather have them nerf burn by nerfing, you know, their burn. Or maybe at least nerfing the card in a way that wouldn't remove it.

I also think they should have buffed some aggro cards at least, considering they nerfed 2 of the most common aggro cards, as well as a spider card, despite aggro already being pretty scarce outside of specifically burn. At least they nerfed the biggest potential abuser of this, that is karma.",1
Irelias going to be released as a 5 mana 1/1 that summons 4 1/1 blades and it will be LoR’s only perfectly balanced card,1
"Yes, a deck with zero need for a good starting hand, with easy to obtain units mostly common, absolutely NEEDS an attainable easy win.
Let's just pick every deck that loses more than 80% and keep buffing their cards so they can have a chance too. I mean, combos? Thinking? Strategy? Who needs those? Every 40 card combination needs a chance people, come on.",1
The deck is way too slow to ever be oppressive. It is a good deck though.,0

"I believe that when balancing you shouldnt only account the ""fairness of a card"", but you should also account what's fun for the player and if by powering up cards that have fallen back you can actually make your players make more intresting decisions.
I'm not saying to buff already strong cards, but in my opinion if a busted card doesnt restrict card design by too much then you should bring the weaker cards to their power levels.

As you said it's more fun to buff than nerf, I'll agree that an amazingly balanced game is dream like but in my opinion you should put the fun and interactivity of the game above anything else",1
1 health is a lot.,0
It has everything to do with how strong it is. The entire philosophy is trying to make sure every champ has a deck and theme and play in their own way. When a deck can just flat out exclude them then thats bad and bypasses a core oart of the game in a way even other meta decks either dont or cant.,1

"So do we get a refund for the nerfed cards?

EDIT: Bad move on riots part if we dont get a refund on nerfed cards. It is the standard set and to not meet it is a mistake. I know it is very easy to complete the collection in this game as a f2p, but by doing this they will lose potential customers/player base. A new player who crafted cards is going to immediately uninstall the game.",-1
"Agreed. There's absolutely no reason to run a 3/1 can't block for 1 mana.

2/2 cant block for 1 would be terrible and directly lesser to other 1 mana characters

3/1 cant block for 0 would make it usable but probably too strong.

Unfortunately this change completely kills the card. It's unplayable now.",-1
"Same here, Karma Lux. 

Thought about it and I've played Karma on turn 5 twice in over 50 games. This Nerf will change almost nothing but the tiniest things. At 6 you can still player her with stored Mana and get another 6-7 Mana worth of spells afterwards. Should work just fine.",1

Okay my bad here,-1
"It can break an opponent’s deck without them knowing their wincon is gone though, and that’s really unfun. Play against Fiora and steal their unyielding, or PnZ/SI and steal their Ledros, etc.",-1
"Being similar to a barrier effect in general if it only lasts one turn, 6 mana seems a bit too much.",0
"Mulligan for your 2 drops as much as possible. Optimal turn 2 is to have a crimson aristocrat or cursed keeper on board, turn 3 if you have both on the board you can transfusion or glimpse to kill the keeper. Most of the damage you'll deal is direct from unblocked units or Vladimir damaging your units, but yes it does struggle with big target removal outside of combat.

The main goal of the deck is to just overwhelm everyone with vlad and hecarim on board if possible. Ideal scenario is to have vlad leveled by turn 6 or so, and hope to have a hecarim down on the board. If they both die you have the option of using the harrowing on turn 7 at the earliest. If it doesn't get denied and it's your attacking turn you'll usually win.

To be fair, it is a bit of a high roll deck and doesn't have the best win rate, but it's really fun to play when it pops off!",1
"Absolutely agreed. 2 mana's nothing. Seeing them swipe 4 cards from you on Round 3 is just ridiculous. 

And yeah Unyielding frankly shouldn't exist at all (when a single card's effect is so ridiculously game-changing that you have to make an entirely new icon in the game just to represent it, it's likely problematic). But if it must stay in the game, and belong to a region that's already stupid strong, it should at least be slow or fast. If you fail to kill the unit before Unyielding activates, then they got you. That's at least a decently fair interaction.",-1

"I suspect that changes that only last one round would not persist on Silent Shadowseer. Though there are no cards with the specific ability I suggested, I’ve tested exact copies with Middenstoke Henchmen and Counterfeit Copies. 

For example, when I cast Counterfeit Copies on 0 cost Tech produced by Heimerdinger, the copies are only 0 cost for the duration of the round that produced them. If you draw them later, they’ve returned to their full cost.

Consequently, though Silent Shadowseer would create an exact copy in hand, I believe the buffs would dissipate on the next round. The synergy comes from cards like Jeweled Protector and Greenglade Elder, or buffs meant for Ephemeral units, which tend to be cost efficient and not specify a duration since Ephemeral units don’t survive for more than one round.

Though... Unyielding Spirit would probably be disgusting with her and Demacia’s other tools, so forget I even made a suggestion. uwu",1
"The ice wolf is already extremely strong for what it is, I can't see it gaining health unless it lost power in the trade",0
"The Karma nerf is interesting tbh. 
Increased cost is nice so she doesn’t start generating spells a turn earlier (can't be played on turn 5), but I thought that maybe they would nerf her health so putting her down before 10 would be risky. 

Like if you wanted to start generating spells you risk losing Karma easier. 

Karma cost increase still makes it hard for people to play spells with her on the same turn I guess.",1
Ahhhyeeeeeeeeeee,0

Good riddance,1
Just had a game where the enemy used shadow flare. My Vi leveled up after battling a unit but she was no longer ephemeral and survived. Is this a bug?,0
"I could think of a few changes they could make.

An obvious one would be to make the pilfer draw a 'virgin' version of the card in the enemy deck, you draw an enemy card but it doesn't retain its buffs. It would be just as fun to draw enemy cards but wouldn't completely screw freljord.

The freljord player can still lose his buffed card so he still has to be mindful and not get too greedy with stacking buffs (while the enemy has opportunity to pilfer) , but it won't be a feel bad massive power swing like right now either.

&#x200B;

I was going to suggest copy a card for a second but imo the option to mill the opponents deck and force them to adapt to losing some of their tools makes the game interesting, even if it can sometimes really leave the person with no options and might discourage buildaround decks.

&#x200B;

A way to balance pilfered goods imo would be to have the plunder bonus draw one of your own cards (so draw one card from enemy deck, and also draw one of your own if you hit enemy nexus this round. Would keep it viable (still get 2 cards for one, still get to draw something from enemy deck) while also being a substantial nerf to this card (which imo is a bit over the top combined with merchant).

That or change merchant to only reduce the cost of the first enemy card drawn each round, although I guess then noone would play him anymore, as he's kind of weak and slow otherwise.",-1

"Getting Champion cards is a pain in the ass still. So imagine you invest 3 Champion wildcards and then it gets nerfed the next day. That's going to turn a lot of people off the game.

"I have been around since day 1 of Open Beta and some of your ideas are ones that I was hoping for as well. Specifically card draw/tutors, neutral card pool, and graveyard.

Oh well we'll see, i hope at least it will become less popular",1

"I feel you and I know you prob won't read this reply, but please don't become shadowverse, and be too scared to nerf op things, at the cost of deck diversity. That's what ruined that game. Because I can understand not wanting to kill decks in a game where you pay for packs and cards because that's a money investment and may be the only top deck some players have, but in your game the cards are earned for free so it's alot easier to build up a collection, meaning nerfing a single card or deck won't kill that region for people as they will most likely have the cards needed to build around the nerfs. Just a thought but slow reaction to op decks or cards, or fear of nerfing higher rarity cards are a major problem in card games as a whole, and leads to alot of people leaving because of frustration, and stale metas. Please don't let this happen to lor I love this game.",1
Capture,0
"Karma's nerf has minor impact, I agree.

It will slow karma deck tempo just a little bit, and make it so that if they do lose Karma on a given turn it may be harder to recover the spell super-spam, but it doesn't fix the problem with Karma.

Her level up is too automatic (Ionia has more than enough tools to stall vs most decks), and her spell spam power flat out doubling the efficiency of spell cast let her flood the board with far too many spells that she can draw far too many of.   Will of Ionia and Deny are both just too cheap for how insanely powerful they are.


If they want to keep Karma's insane late game card efficiency, they need to nerf the mana efficiency of it.  Make her spend the mana for those double-casted spells twice (Not making the second spell auto-fail if not enough mana remains though).",1

Well then what do you suggest?,0
"Dude it isn’t going to be a worse legion grenadier. The difference between one toughness and three is huge. At one toughness cards like withering wail and vile feast not only answer legion grenadier but gain extra value. Also boomcrew rookie is a repeatable effect unlike grenadiers last breath. At four toughness do you know what the first card that answers boomcrew one for one is? It’s vengeance at seven mana. Grasp of the undying deals 3, gotcha deals 3, and get excited deals 3 while requiring your opponent to discard a card. So the earliest way to answer it one for one before the nerfs was to bank three spell mana and cast vengeance. It was a card that warped the meta because of how well it pressured the opponent and nullified early removal. Corina control was able to keep up because of how much life gain it had access to. Even then corina struggled whenever multiple boomcrew rookies were in play because of how much pressure it put on.",1
boomcrew becoming a 1-3 makes it killable by grasp and excited. solid nerf,1
Slotbot meta please we need a casino during quarantine,1
Why nerf Legion Rearguard?  he cant even block.,1
"Dawn and Dusk isn't even really played. The problem is that Spirit is a buff. 

So first off, at slow I can't use it as a combat trick at all, that limits a lot of it's value right there. If I'm defending and you open attack, it's worthless. 

Secondly, it's too easy to completely blow up my play. Now I've invested 8 mana (or more in your scenario) and then there are many, many cards that could kill or otherwise mitigate my creature while the unyielding is on the stack. That's an 8 mana 2 for 1 blowout of tempo and board position. 

Compare that to the expensive slow spells that ARE played: The Ruination can only be stopped by deny. You can play around that, and even if you are denied, you're not being 2 for 1'd. The risk is also commensurate with the reward: if you do get to cast The Ruination, you're probably going way up in card advantage, you may essentially win the game right then and there. Unyielding spirit will rarely win you a game you're badly losing on board. Many of the playable slow spells don't target ally units, this limits how many cards can prevent the spell from happening. 

Making unyielding spirit slow makes it significantly worse for those reasons. You couldn't also increase the cost. The card is already a borderline playable 1-2 of in some decks. While it's true that making it fast or slow would make it more interactable, I don't think that it would be anymore fun. It's still totally binary. Either you have the answer at that exact moment or you don't. Leave it burst and make it 9 mana. One turn can make a huge difference with it.",-1
Stop trying to so obviously farm KARMA.,0
because it wasnt meant as a control card.,0
"Yeah I definitely think it needs to be changed.  I've only been playing since Isles, so I'm no expert, but it seems like you should be able to play around it somehow.  I think fast is the answer, but I wouldn't object to slow.  You might need to lower the cost to 7 if you do that though, I'm not sure.",1

Mogwai is also not every streamer and neither are tournament performances for burn as great as the pitchforks would indicate nor can one see a single 2-drop in action to such an extent to make that conclusion (see above about context within burn, which you dodged).

&#x200B;

The issue that might arise is Aggro being too weak and that's not healthy for the metagame. One could've solved the issue of too much direct damage differently without putting the last nail into discard aggros coffin - for example making Decimate a non collectible card would've removed 3x4 relatively uninteractive damage from the deck, same amount as everyone say is 100% guaranteed from Rookie.",-1

Killing Boomcrew with thermo on turn 2 is huge and saving a lot of hp, also get excited kills boomcrew and Gotcha kill boomcrew(ofc its depending what u play in deck.

"I don't think a mere 2 mana increase on a combo is enough to tone down Karma.   
My issue is that she provides huge value with the easiest lvl up condition in the game ( it's even easier when most of the deck is made to stall out ). 

  
Sure the extra mana might stall the combos by a turn or 2 but you still lose because you simply get outvalued.   


Not to mention most of the stalling cards like Eye of the dragon , Radiant guardian, Will of Ionia didn't get touched.  


Will the winrate of Karma decks go down because of a 2 total mana cost increase? Maybe by 2-3%.  


But they also nerf burn  and demacia midrange so there are fewer decks that can pressure you that much that early to force you to waste all of resources before  turn 10.",1

"First thing I did after seeing these patch notes is add 3x Slotbot to my deck. It was already doing well at least in my TF Expedition decks, I think it could be really strong after this huge buff.",1
"People keep badmouthing the +1 bonus for Shen, but now he can block Fearsome units and kill a LOT of priority targets. Hell, there isn't a single Fearsome card at his cost or lower that can kill even a level 1 Shen, and of the ten Fearsome units that CAN oneshot Shen (level 1 or 2), two of them are leveled up Champions and five of them are from Shadow Isles. So yeah, I'd say that's pretty worthwhile.",-1
"Oh shit, you right.",-1
The patch is on Tuesday.,0
"Just a small correction, there are patches every 2 weeks but only one of these is dedicated to balancing. Every month there is one patch for bug fixes and features and one balancing patch.",1
What? No. Bad burn player. Bad.,-1

Thank you for the insight :),1

"Brb,  asking Sae niijima to burrow us her casino.",0
"I have a feeling the new cards they are working on might have some tools that can be utilized against Unyielding, that might be why they were hesitant to change it. It it’s a card you have to learn to play around but there are regions with no direct answers to it which is why it feels so polarizing.",-1

"No, you get an epic capsule and a ton of Shards. You get like 2k off of the 7 win streak, so you're already 2/3rds of a way to a champion.",1
But think of the Innkeeper lol Riot is playing super safe...not sure if these changes will change the game to the point that Freljord can have a better place on the meta,1
"Additionaly, when I think more about the part you added ""to three randomly selected enemies and the enemy Nexus"" it sounds like it could deal 3 damage in succession to four targets, 1 by 1 by 1 to three units plus nexus. Total damage 12. 9 to enemy units and 3 to Nexus. Really bad change.",-1
"If it wasn't a permanent buff it'd probably be fine. But lo, a splashable permanent buff that makes anything as powerful as some midrange creatures is gonna be hard to balance around. Especially when not every faction has answers.",1
It's not meant to be more valuable. Heimer is supposed to have synergy with specific spells and they chose 3 cost so he can use them with just spell mana if needed.,1
"Yah it’s absolutely going to take the quick steam out of it. And you’re right, this one card could very well be strong enough to...decimate burn. I’ve always played warlock in Hearthstone so I’m very familiar with the huge impact a small amount of healing can do.",1
"I mean vi is still a pretty solid card, now it trades more evenly against a lot of other 5 drops that's all. Reinforce still makes is incredibly resilient against spells. Challenger is still amazing too especially combined with anywhere from 4-10 attack by the time you play her.",1
Broad awakening nerf is a buff to my Lux thresh deck,0
"To be fair it can be easy to miss just how huge even small number changes can be, especially in the spur of the moment. People like to meme about how -5 or +5 MS are ridiculously small nerfs in League, but they can decide things like whether you can escape or chase down a target, or whether or not you can roam quickly enough. Similar in tabletop; people might think a measly +1 or -1 is nothing compared to doing Xd6 damage, but even those small modifiers can potentially decide the outcome.

Even then, it's not like Shen doesn't have his problems as-is. His only option for Barrier support is working in Demacia/Ionia decks- when Demacia has no shortage of other options- and the ""Support"" tag seems overall fairly weak if you're not War Chef or Kato the Arm. Doing 3 or 4 damage is absolutely going to be huge- It's the equivalent of a Black Spear, Get Excited, and Grasp after all, which is part of what makes 3 HP vs 4 HP such a huge breakpoint- and he has more options with regards to blocking, but for all I know it could end up doing absolutely fuck all for him. It all depends on how things pan out over the course of the next month.",1
It doesn't,0
It was never as bad as it was post launch.,1
"Its now Legion Saboteur, only worse.  A 1 drop isnt going to be going into 3 health units usually.  Saboteur was already a pretty weak card...",-1

I think he was bugged specifically to take out the noxus 3 health cards because he is basically an anti aggro tool. Good buff imo,0
The card is unplayable with even one of your suggestions. Just say you want the card deleted from the game since that's effectively what you want.,1
"Ezreal is pretty powerful. I'm sure that some other ez build will become meta if karma/ez falls out of favor.

Of you're interested in it for fun, I'd definitely still craft it. Otherwise wait it out a few weeks and see if the deck still performs.",1
Burn is not all the aggro decks... Im sad i have to explain that.,-1
This game is way more generous in exchange.,1
"The fact you dont understand what the first part of my comment means is astonishing yet not surprising considering you dont understand the consequences of such timer in LoR.

"He can only heal up to 5 every 2nd turn, thats not that much. Still a neat buff though",1
"It still forces the opponent to have a turn 1 answer or face 3 damage, I think it's warranted because burn needed more than 1 nerf if we're being honest",0
"Except for the freljord players you're going against, doing so ruins their entire experience. So the net fun is fucking terrible.

"Deny, Purify, Single Combat, Will, Transmogrifyer, Annihilate, Frostbite... all answers to a late game atrocity. Or you could just play fearsome units, have a faster clock, or overwhelm their chumps.

I think nerfing both of them is kinda weird,0
He obviously never bothered to even try to understand the deck buried under all the salt.,0

Legion Rearguard is only good in a deck that values really early game because it falls off. And theres kinda only 1 like that and it just got nerf rekt.,1
"Aside from the lack of making Braum playable and a pilfering nerf, this patch is fantastic! It's everywhere I want to be!",1
"#CHAMPS

* Vlad buff was a direct suggestion from this sub, was it not? I think it helps Vlad recover from a bad early game but still doesn't fix the other core issues with the card. (Notably that it's slow as hell.)

* Karma being 6 mana actually helps a lot because it means that on a 13 mana turn you'll only have 7 mana to do bullshit with her. Means you can only deny one removal spell; not two.

* Shen attack increase really doesn't matter in the long-run. Makes him a little more dangerous I guess.

* Literally why is Vi being nerfed she dies so easily to any strong removal????? Should either cost less or have more base attack 😩 (Then again probably just saying this because I'm bad and gay for Vi)

* Hecarim buff makes him actually dangerous doesn't fix the fact that Ethereal decks are kinda meh at the moment. (Too easy to chump block atm.)

#UNITS

* Literally who plays Greathorn Companion? This makes the card more viable but still doesn't fix the fact that Grizzled Ranger (as well as the Scout cards from Bilge) are far stronger.

* Loyal Badgerbear nerf thank fucking Christ, though Grizzled Ranger still insanely good because Last Breath.

* Laurent Chevalier is epic maymay and it still won't be run.

* About fucking time Legion Redguard got nerfed. The thing is that this card is now extremely weak since it's a 3/1 that can't block and can't get hit by 2/3 Bomb Lady. Agro decks and burn decks might shift away from this card now and try for other 1 drops... is it possible that we'll see some Discard synergy return with Zaunite Urchin and Scrap Scuttlers?

* Kindly Tavernkeeper buff is nice but feels unnecessary.

* About fucking time Boomcrew Rookie got nerfed.

* Fizz (indirect) buff is interesting. Seems like this was more-so directed towards Expedition play which makes sense.

* Literally what even is Monkey Idol I have never seen this card.

* Literally who has ever even played Slotbot.

#SPELLS

* About fucking time Stand Alone got nerfed.

* RIP Deep Meditation but I do agree that the spell was way too good.

* Brood Awakening nerf? Who actually plays Spider decks anymore lmao.

#WATCHLIST

* The problem with Unyielding Spirit is that the only proper counter to it is either recalls or Obliterate effects, which only select decks have. More universal removal needs to be added to make this card less oppressive.

* The problem with card stealing decks is that they can often steal tons of cards for nothing. Even in the worst case scenario ""add 2 random cards to hand; they cost 2 less"" is insane.

* Nexus damage (IE burn decks) did go up dramatically in Rising Tides but the big problem is the lack of face healing. Either more healing needs to be added to compensate for the added burn, or the Nexus needs more base HP.

* I think the Karma nerf made her more balanced. The problem with Ezreal is that there's pretty much zero counterplay to him if comboed with Burst Cards. (Which he often is cough Puffcaps cough)",-1
"Everyone here be talking about balance changes, honestly I'm really glad they added a generic board/sleeve. It feels pretty lame imo playing with an off theme deck/board/sleeve combo, so having a board/sleeve that you can use with any deck is nice for budget players. Free poro is also really nice, considering how ugly the moonlight poro is lol. Bonus for gayness

Personally, I'm kinda disappointed with the Ezreal emote tho, kinda feels like all the Ezreal art is getting shafted in this game but oh well. The best emote seems to be Elise, though even then I don't think it can really compete with current meta emotes. The design isn't bad, just the BM niche is pretty oversaturated at this point, with the likes of Braum, Thresh, Vlad, Darius, etc. The new poro emote also seems pretty good, competing with Shen for opening/closing a game (although closing would only work on a win) but also for pulling off a big play or something. The second card in the Teemo art is a little confusing, and it seems a little too niche for topdecking situations. Draven is just...a little too innocent? While I can see Ezreal being used while you see your opponent shifting a bunch of spells on their turn or something, I don't think it can really compete with Gangplank in the same niche.",1

Riot can't see the forest through he fucking forest.",1
Bilgewater is buts without card stealing wdm,1
"After a while, non-rotating formats end up like what you describe, and it makes matchup polarization higher due to decks being VERY GOOD and consistent at what they do and unless you have a tech card against them (or your deck naturally counters them), or you will lose without much chance to do anything.

A lower powerlevel like right now means not drawing perfectly/missplaying a bit will slow down your wincondition a certain amount of turns, wich gives the opponent more chances to come back from its bad matchup trough good plays, while in a format with extremely powerfull stuff, you can expect to only be slowed down a turn at max because you will draw more than half of your deck in the earlygame and most of it by 1 or 2 turns later (or you power-tutor the cards you need to win).

A formatlike the one you mention will naturally appear in this game too after a decent number of expansions in whatever the name for the non-rotating format for this game will be. But its way better and healthier to let it appear naturaly through card getting more and more synergies to combo with, than with artificially just increasing the powerlevel of cards every 2 weeks.",1

They are still able to kill you fast and early on without much attacking and instead just killing their units (crimsons and grenadiers), using casks and spells. Some are running Draven or Darius.",-1

Spamming Braum emote will have chance that your nexus will explode for no reason.,-1
"I sorta wanted to see Scarmother and her other Scar-clan cards on here.

If they become ""unable to take damage or die"", they shouldn't be able to buff their power. Since they don't take any damage, I find it hard to accept that it should be counted as ""surviving"" damage in order for the buff to happen, since no damage was technically done for them to survive.",-1
"Although the crimson can Be played that way part of the reason it fails is due to it not getting enough value till turn 7+ if you are lucky. Control decks will outvalue as you don’t have much to kill with compared to lux, karma, heimer, which will come online when you do. Aggro you might survive but you won’t have units to drain. Drain will be useless vs control. 

So if you can’t drain vs aggro or burn since your units won’t survive.

Drain will do nothing vs control.

Can you drain vs combo? Mill will kill. Ezreal will probably just kill all your units before you can drain back up. I just don’t see how this will be used.

Also drain will do nothing for scarred decks. And lastly which bothers me is it adds no synergy. So you are still either vlad alone or with braum. No synergy with bilgewater, swain, sej, Darius, Kat draven ect. Vlad needs something to fill a combo/finisher role to create more interactivity with cards. If you make him deal dmg to nexus whenever an ally survives damage you can stun with swain, hit nexus for gp and sej, lower nexus health for Darius, and probably more I can’t think of. He just became more stuck where he is. Riot won’t reverse this and give him something actually useful and interesting",-1
demacia midrange is still strong i believe. the bears are still pretty decent cards,1
What if Shadowseer created an exact copy? That would be very rewarding to watch it gradually grow in power if you can consistently hit the Nexus! :0,1
"I mean, yes? But also, you gotta remember that he takes a champion slot, and I dont think youd even consider splashing him vs various other options (Garen, Karma, Lux, Lucian, Fiora, Quinn, ZED? All better than him).

He himself is just bad. His thicc health is super and can trade into a lot of stuff (even better now), but he has NO keyword which would help, eg. Fearsome or Regen. He is literally the altruistic ""You go on, leave me"" champ. 

On top of that, 4 mana demacia pool... Competes with Bannerman AND grizzled ranger? Uiuiui. 

Maybe theres a weird non-demacian deck for him out there, but until then, Shens very mediocre.",1

Also - the game is free. Maybe if you’re playing it that much and enjoying you should support the developers?",1

"Yeah, that's why defensive spells are really important. The main thing is I need to build up an army to hit the base, and ONLY attack once I have a big enough army. Then, keep my Fleetfeather trackers or valors alive with barrier when I challenge fiora. That way I can deal like, 10+ damage to their nexus in an attack, while forcing Fiora to block a weak bird. Then I can just do it again. Fiora might be able to get a kill or two from all of that, but by that point they're dead, lol

I imagine something similar could be done with other regions, just endlessly frostbiting Fiora with Freljord, or stunning Fiora with Noxus units.",-1

It’s so gross. I have to dust off my Vlad deck now,-1
"If you’re looking to learn the game, I’d recommend a midrange Demacia deck like Bannerman. Burn aggro was arguably a poor introduction to the game for a lot of players.

"Did those have the same generous  ""free""-card reward system LoR does? Not /s because I literally don't know lol. 

It doesn't feel like that big a deal when you can earn more champs relatively quickly and the meta is going to keep changing anyway. For all we know Vi could be better in the future. Likewise, the most meta champ now, that you wish you could've had instead, could be nerfed away in the next patch.",1
"Could you explain how thats a nerf, not a buff?",0
"The reasoning for the nerf makes sense though. 

It was too punishing if you didn't have a turn 1 option to get it off board Because if you didn't have an option to take it off board turn 1, then chances are you were using a 2 cost unit or spell to take it off board, giving your opponent an advantage on mana use. 

And while you're using 2 mana setting up to get rid of rear guard, whether that be using a mystic shot or putting down a 2 attack unit, your opponent is either playing a boomcrew rookie turn 2 or playing 2 1 costs units, which is pushing you even further behind. 

With the introduction of Rising Tide Noxus got significant burn damage added to its region (Imperial Demolitionist, Noxian Fervor) which means that the 6-7 damage that really didn't matter that much before that you were taking pre-turn 3 suddenly becomes a really big problem and by turn 4/5 if you haven't taken complete control over the board you're suddenly in a really bad spot and a lot of that came from the consistent pressure that comes out from having a rear guard turn 1.

Now whether or not it needed 1 hp as the nerf is a separate matter. It's still pretty strong but 1 hp is a big nerf. But Rearguard probably needed to be weakened.",-1
"Sorry, I just don’t think the nerfs are substantial.",0
You can’t really decide what is crippling or not you need a clear rule and if the rule is that they don’t give anything I’m ok with it but it’s good to know,1

 I hope so.,1
So like.... Yasuo buffs? No?,-1
"Fair enough.  I'm not opposed to all RNG in games or anything but there certainly are lines that cross the barrier between good RNG and bad RNG.   That line won't be in the same place for everyone.  To me Slotbot hits that point, to you it doesn't...neither of us are wrong.",-1

"> Nothing got nerfed into oblivion

Legion Rearguard and Stand Alone would want to have a word with you.",0
"You truly have no clue on what you're talking about. The whole stand alone deck is filled with cheap survival tools : chain vest, elixir of iron, twin disciplines, deny, riposte and unyielding spirit.

If you want to trade with the card, you have to do it on turn 3. Otherwise they can play a (cheaper) counter to your removal. Also, a buffed Zed applies tremendous pressure that will force you to sacrifice some cards, ruining your so-called argument of card advantage.

Thermo can answer it on turn 3, but you have to pass turn 1-2 as well and you have to use it AFTER their attack, meaning you lost up to 12 health and Zed level up for a measly one card advantage.

Only Will was a good answer. Riot has realized and rightfully addressed the issue you still fail to acknowledge.",-1
"Nope, its not identical. 

Assume you have a 24 cards deck or something (not counting champions).

The chance of your one card win condition being stolen is 1/24. It can be stolen anywhere in the deck.

However, the chances of your win condition being in the bottom portion of your deck that you will never draw is 12/24 or something (depends on game length, draw potential, etc.)! Basically, number of cards remaining in your deck at the end of the game (undrawn cards)/total size of your deck in the beginning (all cards).

Basically, if your win condition is a single card, the odds of not drawing it are much higher than the odds of it being stolen... Much, much higher. 

Dont compare the odds with "" odds of card being the literal last card"", but as "" one of the cards youll never draw "" which isnt defined (not 1/24 specifically) but can vary yet never beat Pilfered Goods' odds.",1
Do we have any idea what ranked rewards are yet? Just remembered since Empress mentioned the second half of the ranked season,1
"You have a lot of downvotes but I completely agree with you. This game used to have some pretty cool aggro decks. But after the patch they wernt that strong anymore. Aggro in this game needs to do early game damage and then have a way to finish the opponent off when he start stabilizing. The thing with burn was that they were super efficient with finishing off the opponent after they ""stabilized"", while every other traditional aggro deck had trouble finishing off the opponent. Instead of nurfing the incredible finishing power of burn they actually nerfed the early game strength. This in turn completely destroys all other aggro decks. Now the only aggro decks left are the demacia aggro decks like scouts which are more mid range to begin with.

Look at how this game started with really cool aggro, mid range, and control decks. Now it is quickly becoming ""play whatever you want until turn 7-9, where you finish off your opponent with one combo"". Meanwhile they have added quite a bit of RNG and cards that are really hard to counter (unless you play Will of course).

Riot is in their right to model this game to their liking. And if you are a player that likes these hard finishing combo's around turn 7-9 then all the power to you. But in its current direction I don't think this is the game for me anymore.",1
"I believe making it fast would help to see some kind of counterplay for tons of regions since the problem right now is that only 2 regions can easily ""deal"" with it once it was cast. Bilgewater with Devourer of the Depths can Obliterate it, but the requirements for that to happen are high and can be easily countered.  


And its effect is still strong, even if it's fast!",1

"Is that really a healthy winrate meta-wise, though? If the worst control has to deal with is a 50% matchup, then it's really, really strong.",1
"Since you want to exaggerate my point, I'll go ahead and do the same with yours.

According to your logic, every game should just be 40 random cards so every game is different and nothing is predictable.

I also enjoy the randomness that comes with card games, I just don't think that a 2 mana draw 2 along with a toxic mechanic is fun in the game.",1
"Omg yeeeess, I didn't know the cause but when it happens I start blinking and robbing My eyes thinking that is my vision, it's so uncomfortable.",-1
"> Yeah cool...but ephemeral decks aren't a thing. So you're improving the champion's performance in a deck that doesn't exist?

So Riot should just ignore any deck that doesn't already exist and focus only on the ones that do? 

Sounds like ridiculous logic if you ask me. Ephemerals aren't a thing because they're too weak for the current meta. With nerfs room is made for other decks, and while I don't think Ephemerals will be one of them, you're never going to get to the point where an Ephemeral deck ""is a thing"" unless required power shifts are made.

> I like how they say because Rising Tides gave too much nexus damage....their solution is to nerf non-Rising Tides cards.

I feel like you're being painfully obtuse about this. If you seriously don't understand the logic then I'll spell it out for you: Rising Tides added a ton of redundancy to Nexus damage, dramatically increasing its availability. While Rising Tides added the straws that broke the camel's back, *that doesn't mean they are any more problematic than cards already in the game.* A straw is a straw, and whichever ones you remove will take weight off. Boomcrew Rookie is the perfect example of a nerf-primed target, where its nerf would definitely be effective, but probably not lethal to the card itself.

Just because Boomcrew Rookie isn't ""new"" doesn't mean it doesn't add to the problem. That's way too simple a perspective to be effective when thinking about design in a CCG.

But you have something of a point with Vi. She's so effective at what she does that she slots in as a splash-pick for a variety of decks, including even Demacia Bannerman. While there are cards that synergise with her more than others, she reaps so much value that just about *any* cards synergise with her well enough.

But that's why she's getting nerfed. The same for Hecarim's prior nerf. If they're too powerful on their own, you dial them back so that they succeed in less instances, but are still likely to do something when properly facilitated by the deck they're put in.",1
"I'm glad it will be changed eventually..but..

..I just feel tho it might have been a better approach to nerf(even if it involves killing it) the card now to save us from the extremley frustrating and unbalanced experiences we have to go through with it for another month. I think it's best for the card to be in a way gone from the game until you figure out how to reintroduce it with it's rework a month from now. 

Definitely shouldn't be this mindset for most cards that are just too strong and are just off a little stat wise, but this card creates a terribly unfun and uninteractive mechanic that puts the whole game of LoR to a halt as we know it and should have been addressed with priority.",1

"Don’t forget Parrrley. It always makes me hesitant to play Teemo and Fizz first turn into Bilgewater. Vile Feast at least costs 2 mana so they can’t cast it on the first turn, and, when they can cast it, you’ll have 2 mana of your own to hopefully protect Teemo and Fizz.",0

I was also just realizing that the burn aggro deck really needs every point of mana efficiency, but the piltover/bilgewater deck has a ton of value (that draw two enemy cards plunder card they’re watching seems broke), so if your opponent spends 3 mana to take out rookie it’s not as big of a deal in that deck as it would be in aggro burn (and if you open attack you still get the two damage out so it’s actually an even worse value trade then)",-1

On paper it seems like almost nothing...she was often dropped on turn 9 or 10 backed up by protection spells already.  I honestly don't see how this one mana change has a real impact on her use.

As an Expedition-only player, this is a pretty huge nerf to Karma. The bulk of her power in draft comes from generating free spells to bury your opponent under card advantage. Since a lot of the spells that really pull their weight in Expeditions don't actually get better when they're doubled (freeze spells, Recall effects, stuns, shield spells), having her level up isn't nearly as good as it is in constructed games. Having a full fewer spell generated by her in a game is a big deal.",1

"Vlad as a champ is just kind of underwhelming, he levels up in the deck so it’s hard to see them push a huge bonus when he levels up but maybe something like keeping him a 5/5 level 2 and giving him +1/+1 every time a friendly unit survives damage until end of turn",1

"1 extra mana isn't ""enormous"" when she still has insane value once lvled up.   
Besides she was never played on curve, it's always round 9 or 10 whch means you still have a lot of mana to spare to protect her on round 9 ( 3 - 6 mana is enough for deny/twin discplines/mist call/will of ionia/spirit refuge) and on round 10 you have 4-7 mana for the same spells.

Now it's going to be 2 most of the time and she gets put down by other similarly priced units such as Garen, Gangplank or Hearthguard.",-1

Duo : possible, but a 5/4 on turn 3 is much healthier than a 7/6. That being said, to make it worth you would have to summon units, which A) prevents you to use other Stand Alone, and B) leaves you with less mana to protect Duo with spells.",1
"I don’t know why I didn’t think to pair Vlad with Garen, I’ve been using Braum and having fun, especially with the Fre card that gives +3 +3 to damaged allies and the Scar units that do more damage when they take damage. Demacia sounds like a fun combo tho.",0

"It just did a lot, it was 6/3 stats for 5 spell mana, buffed all your spiders, and could insta-level Elise. Spell mana meant it could be played early too, on turns 3 or 4 if you skipped turn 2, or floated some mana. I felt 5 was a bit cheap for what it did.",1
"> My worry is that it’s too easy for 2 players to build decks that lean too heavy into something and you end up with lots of strong decks that just build towards the win condition.

I agree that this is the problem with strong neutral cards, and it happens all the time. I have personally only played MTG and Hearthstone to a great extent, and in both scenarios strong neutrals are just universally bad for the game. In MTG they also don't really exist except when they push artifact sets or busted land cards, and whenever they do that, Standard breaks and they end up banning stuff. They've learned since and stopped printing powerful artifacts that have no color.

So while my original argument agaisnt it was based on the theme, I probably have more opposition to it from a gameplay perspective. I think there is very little advantage to be gained at all, and the potential downsides are huge.",1

RIP Brood. They murder your boy for nothing.,-1
"The buffs are ok to me, just take it from the bottom of the deck though",0
"I mean the nerf on Vi was necessary. It was getting run in Mono Demacia just because if you played it on curve it came down as a 6/5 with tough, challenger and had the potential to get bigger.

I was hoping Vlad would see more of a buff, the drain option is interesting though and gives you the option to run a deck that comes online a little bit later. I have some concepts with Ember Maiden in Freljord I'd like to try, might even throw in some buff cards if the steal package ever gets nerfed.",1
"It was a two mana card that was guaranteed to do three damage if you swung on turn two. It was nearly impossible to trade with because of how much toughness it had early in the game. I used to play corina control and a lot of the time the matchup was decided by how well I played around boomcrew. Could I make my spiders whittle it down to the point where I could possibly gain back the life I lost from his static? If yes I would win, if not I lost. The card created a warped meta because of how busted burn was.",1
"What I said about Shen and Vlad are legit concerns. Buffing Shen's attack does little to nothing to alleviate his problem or his payoff for including him in a deck. Vlad's buff does little to nothing to his real problem.  


As for unyielding, ezreal and pilfered, my concerns for these are valid too. Pilfered stealing from the bottom would be an acceptable change and would change very little for decks surrounding the mechanic besides their matchup against freljord which is in a weak state. Ezreal's leveled up interaction with burst cards is a problem that has been pointed out many times. His interaction with fast and slow cards are very much acceptable and I don't think many players would disagree with this statement.

I see daily topics about unyielding. I know the data says it's not an exceptional card but there are too few ways to deal with it for some deck variants. 

You have to realize that while yes balance of cards is important it's much worse to leave something untouched that might lose us players even if it isn't that good of a card.",-1
"Eye of the Dragon really helps against burn because casting two spells in the previous turn makes them summon a 2/1 ephemeral lifesteal. I run 2 Deny in my deck, the stuns and recalls are usually enough for whatever people throw at me that I don't need the extra copies.",0
"I'm assuming you mean Bannerman+Vi, which while nerfed, will probably still be tier 1",0
"Mana changes are always underrated on card games. Cards have been killed just by increasing mana cost, especially on late game cards. For a local example look at rhasa who went from the best card in the game at 7 mana to never played at 8.

That isn't to say karma will suddenly disappear.. just saying that changes may not be as small as they seem. If she still seems too strong I'd rather they try changing her to ""repeat first spell"" or ""add fleeting 0 cost copy"" than to completely ruin her with your suggested change.",-1
"It could be ""deal 1, then heal 1""",0
"His issue in beta was the fact that his horses would swing for 6 damage without any prior set up. The changes they made to he arum by moving more of his power to his level up was more than enough of a nerf. Hitting him to 5 health was overkill and completely removed him from the meta. I would love to see him with his original statline and where he is at currently. I feel he is in a great spot and doesn’t need much change other than returning him to his former 6 hp glory that he truly deserves. 

I am not disagreeing that a 1 attack buff is nothing to scoff at, however a 6 mana unit with 5hp has some very serious implications. It means he cannot swing into 5 drop units effectively which is the main issue with plying hecarim currently (especially because Vi exists)",1
"Agreed. Even at slow speed, would you put it at 7 mana? That's the same turn you would be able to use Redoubled Valor, which is also slow (unless you find a way to cheat mana).",0
Probably not. It's a good buff and I can see Vlad at least seeing some play now but that buff didn't break him unless that change applies when he's not flipped.,0
"They listed their reasoning, they have access to a lot of date. One can't say they are wrong about why as it is based on direct data they have.

Maybe the how can be argued.

They may have not nerfed him in an ideal way and it may be adjusted in a future patch if what you say is true and he drops of from use.

Also he is still subject to buffs that can bump him up into a target killer with good timing as 3 attack at 1 cost with the right spell makes for a cheap combo.  A card is always more than just how it itself works, but also how it pairs.

All things said, the fact that ""Unyielding Spirit"" and ""Pilfer Goods"" were not adjusted is more bothersome imo.

Their reasoning",-1
I remember him being a 2/6 but not him having 3 power. Are you sure about that?,1

2. Most games do not incentivize playing more than 2h per day because people who have a life do not play more than 2h a day and wont push for more.

But I thought everyone ran Mighty Poro as their icon!,0
"Dw about rearguard it won’t be played anymore 3/1 can’t block is useless. The cards strength was based on the fact that it either did a good amount of damage to nexus or got a good trade.

With 1 hp it has almost no reason to exist and will probably never be played in any viable deck",1

"Personally I don't feel like LoR is as generous as people think. It seems most of the people who say it's so, so generous played a lot when Expeditions were great for building out your Champion collection. I started with 1.0 and it is brutal trying to build decks because of the heavy Champion investment necessary.

At least with Hearthstone you had lots of common/rare only beginner decks that could be somewhat viable (such as Warlock Zoo). In LoR even the most beginner friendly decks require 5 or 6 champions to be decently viable.",1
Well clearly you haven't experienced having your opponent make a move when its 3-5 seconds before the timer expires every turn they get... Feel free to question my sanity because I definitely had enough of that. I'm just asking for the timer to not go back to its full length everytime they make a turn.,1
If that's the case you're probably fine to go ahead and craft him,0

Completely unrelated to the patch at all but...when should I be building decks as a new player? I'm super overwhelmed because I stopped playing during the beta and started getting back into things now but I have...absolutely no idea what to do. It could just be shock but I really have no idea when I should be building decks. I just get on and play normals with the standard free decks until I get my pvp wins (which can take hours unless i get lucky and people auto surrender) and I feel like this would go faster if I started building decks but I feel like I don't have nearly enough cards. I've been sitting in game for about 3 hours now trying to get my last two pvp wins and it's just feeling like a slog. Should I just slap a bunch of cards together for a deck and go from there? I really have no idea what to do here.,1
game's finally playable,0
"I started with 1.0, too. I don't play ranked, so I'm fine with having a mismatched champ pool in norms while I fiddle with a new deck. I still have fun even if I included a ""suboptimal"" Heimerdinger (who can still carry the game). There are also the infamous champ-less decks >:(

Admittedly, I would have had significantly less time to play (and thus get cards) if it wasn't for the pandemic. I also started playing lots of expeditions to try out different champs and that satisfies my novelty craving. I can see how that might not work for everyone.

So I can definitely see how the satisfaction is different based on how many decks you want to perfect right away, but I think it's pretty awesome I can have this much fun without paying anything!",1
At this point they might as well give hawk to any other region and just remove freljord from the game =/,0
it would suck if you do that.,-1
"In the short term, yes because it was generally overtuned. In the long term, it goes against riots own stated goal that each card is at least playable (not necessarily competitive). This card is no longer even playable. 

I think a better compromise would have been a generic 3 mana 3/1. Ditch the no block aspect and it actually seems fair imo.",-1
Maybe. Still glad they're fixing it.,1
Yea for like 2 seconds until you see his leveled up face LOL,1
"Why? The Karma nerf changes nothing for that deck since you should not play Karma before turn 9 most of the times. The ranger nerf was mandatory and doesn't change the fact that's it's still 2 bodies withe the second one having 4HP, and it was clear it needed a nerf.",0
"I disagree about burn but the larger point of this is to balance the game, not make burn totally useless. Burn being viable isn't a problem, it's just a problem when it's overpowered. Part of its popularity, though, is how relatively easy it is to pilot for how strong it is. So you'll still see it, but I think you should wait and see how this impacts your games before saying they need to do more.",1
"lol but thats not how it should be, atleast in my opinion, Cithria is 1 mana 2/2 Elite, Butcher is 2/2 and with plunder can be 3/3, the SI thing that i dont know the name is 1/1 and can be a 3/3 if something dies, not a hard condition for SI to achieve, Rearguard is just a 3/1 that cant even block, thats not balanced at all, he is way weaker then other 1 mana units.",0
Brood is nerved because CorVina and Endure Spider. Spider Aggro is not even a thing in the Meta anymore...,0
"The problem with Burn has never been interacting with it, although it is historically extremely difficult to interact in any meaningful way with Burn. Half of the problem is that its average goldfish TTK is extremely low, and competes with the best-case goldfish TTK of comparable decks; the other half is that even if you interact with the deck, it is rarely slowed down to any appreciable extent.

And taking Boomcrew Rookie down a point of power still doesn't address really either of those issues. So now it dies to Gotcha or Grasp? That still means you're spending ~3 or 5 mana to kill a 2 mana creature that probably got an attack off anyways. It still 1 for 2's most other 2 drop creatures, and again, still gets its attack off in most of those scenarios.

And while it's true Rearguard got smacked down, bear in mind that almost every single Noxus deck runs 3 of it. If all of the aggro competition takes the same nerf as Burn, Burn is still on top of the aggro pile. All this does is strengthen control's position in the meta, which obviously Riot considers already a massive issue from their slaughter of Shadow or Ionia control decks.",-1
"The Hecarim buff is about to really revamp the Zed Hecarim combo and I’m all for it. Overall the patch seems decent and not really appealing or selling out to one specific deck type or completely destroying another. Although the burn  aggro took a hit, I’m kinda fine with it since I’ve been getting a lot of matches with them on my climb to Diamond.",0
Which is why one is double the cost,0
She's still auto include. Still takes double grasp / double get excited to kill her. Just doesnt trade as well with 5 attack minions as she used to.,-1
"Sej variants are going to be extremely strong now that burn (the deck’s hardest counter) is gone and she kills Vi.

With burn being significantly weaker and Tavern Keeper receiving a buff, EZFreezy is going to be a very strong choice as well.",1
Also makes it so you can't throw her down twice after she's enlightened. Really only affects will of ionia or if they have two copies of her,1
"Ahhh was it 1 more hp? I might have gotten it wrong then.

I know he has one more stat.
Apologies for the confusion!",-1
"Nah, it shouldn't. Mystic Shot is ok as it is now",0
"The problem with that is that at 5 Mana WoI would be unplayable.

I think making it slow, but reducing it's cost to 3 might put it in a good place.",1
"The karma nerf is barely noticeable. After playing 3 days full of karma lux, even though the deck received 4 nerfs, it's still busted.
The seer amount of sustain with radiant guard, single combat and the new 5 mana strike spell is nuts not to mention the lack of early pressure decks allow you to easily reach round 10 without using health pots.

Once you reach round 10 you just win the game.

I only lose to sejuani decks if they draw well and I draw nothing useful or if they steal my wills.

Karma doubling spells even if they don't get value just makes lux shine. Ironically the nerf to deep meditation really helps this deck since you double cast for 3 and lux get a final spark without spending more mana than needed.


I hope they really address her, and the whole deck of karma lux in the next balance patch.


It's still early and there are probably better decks in the making but karma lux is still just as strong as before despite the quadruple nerf.",1
"Yes I don't see why? How long would it take for the first timer to burn out? How about the second timer when  an opponent fails to make a move?

Man I am not spending 20 minutes for 1 game when it could have been over in 10 minutes or less even then get 100 xp. Either make the timers consumable or at least don't regenerate to full length and have a minimum value or incentivize longer meaningful gameplay by adding more exp (which I dont see happening).",1
You get a downvote too,0
I think it’s a great nerf. It also prevents using Rearguard as an alternate Demolitionist target when you don’t draw a Disciple.,1
"that sounds pretty fun, the challenge is building the deck in a way that will vlad to level up without to much trouble and still combo well at the end",1

love it love you love this love this love that amazing patch and the board is stunning possibly the best board out there NO CONTEST love the free poro for the community (thanks BTW) and the card back,1
Turn 2 Thermo is huge. It is hard nerf. Was expecting him to go 0/4.,0
"Thanks for the quick reply. Well, that's messed up, looks like I need to write some kind of complaint to Riot so maybe they'll fix it.",0
"Let's get the bad stuff out of the way:  

Vi nerf: worrying precedent. PZ is starved for statlines. What does this mean for Mundo, Warwick, Urgot, and maybe even Janna, whose identities are defense and imposing stats?  Vi filled an important niche, and I don't think punishing her for that *this quick* is a good idea.

Karma: didn't need it IMO. Wasn't a goodstuff champ ala old Hecarim/current Elise, doesn't have problematic play patterns, and is only good at a very particular point in the game, if built around. Also only present in one deck (though Karma Ez might still be a thing). Felt like she checked all the boxes for reasonable. Guess not.  

Deep meditation: get a free 3/1 elusive turret if you played 2 spells last turn. Okay.  

Hecarim: I don't like pushing him back into goodstuff territory. Hecarim isn't the reason that ephemerals aren't in a good spot, and turning him into more of a goodstuff champion seems to risk repeating the mistakes of the past.  

Stand alone: card essentially got deleted, as did its deck. Riot seems to really despise permanent buffs. If so, why even make the cards in the first place?  If ""make 'em have it"" isn't allowed to be a strategy that can exist, why make cards to support it?

Now, for the good stuff: 

Everything else. Grizzled ranger and his bear needed the nerf for sure. They were obviously too good from looking at them, and got their obvious and reasonable nerf.   

Champless burn was obnoxious, and got some reasonable whacks, though I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of its toxic play patterns.   

Friendly tavernkeeper getting a buff is also a ""we'll take those"" sort of thing, but also feels like Irelia's +10 damage on her E while being one of the worst champs in LoL.  Feels like Catalyst could have come back down to 4, for sure, along with a lot of Freljord nerfs from closed beta.  

Shen getting a buff is definitely nice, but that said, the problem with Shen is that he feels like the fourth best thing you can do with the ""Demacia board-contesting midrange"" plan (I.E. bannerman Vi, bannerman Zed, bannerman deny, etc.), and there are probably better champs to complement Fiora with (namely Garen and Vi), and the +1 attack to Shen doesn't really change this.  

Vlad getting a buff is interesting, and this might make his payoff worth it. I'm not sure I like Vlad being good though; he's ugly and creepy and ewww. But objectively speaking, he definitely could have used the buff for sure.  

Buffs I'd like to see in the future:  

A bunch of Ionia's low end. Emerald Awakener is hot garbage. The cheap hand-buff cards are trash. Inspiring mentor can be reverted, greenglade elder was never good, and Sown Seeds is utter card disadvantage as it stands. All of them try to do this very convoluted thing, meanwhile Demacia just laughs and plays a bannerman. Ionia's enlightenment fantasy also feels not there. Yes, Karma is good, but that's *Karma*. All the rest of the ""reach 10 mana"" stuff in Ionia (and in Freljord, for that matter) is garbage. Rush and ghost both also feel like trash.  

Freljord is a region I'd love to see get some of its former power back. It got absolutely shellacked in closed beta. For the record, I'd like to see a burst WMC, SWW back at 9 mana and regenerating (though I don't think anything should obliterate champions--including devourer of the deep!), and catalyst back at 4 mana.  

In Demacia, mageseekers as an archetype is still nonsense. Lux is good, her surrounding cast very much isn't. Elites are also in the same boat. When's the last time battlesmith was playable? A 2/3 vanguard defender would be very interesting, and maybe a 3/2 barrier scout dude whose name escapes me.  

Also, it seems the Scouts archetype just generally isn't very good. It just feels like you give up bannerman and run worse champions because...reasons. Quinn isn't better than Garen (and still probably not better than Vi), Genevieve is still inferior to Cithria, and so on.  

In Shadow Isles, ephemerals the lack of blocking *and* the fact that these units are one and done is still a brutal 1-2 punch that would mean these cards need to be grossly overtuned to make up for that. Not sure what the fix is.",1
"Definitely gonna give it a go, plunder and keg pressure seems potent although Jinx's innate problem of emptying your hand as a risk is still hard to solve with any region so far.",0
"Brood tier was too strong in too many decks was the issue. You shouldnt have lower tier decks ""carried"" by a single card, espically if that card is also a staple in higher tier decks. A cards strength can usually be split up in to two power levels, 

How good that card is in one type of deck (think boomcrew rookie)

And how good a card is in MULTIPLE decks (will of ionia/brood awakening)

If a card passes either powerlevel threshold, it needs changed. Brood awakening, while not in to many s tier decks, was In so many a/b tier decks that if one of them got strong it would be a problem card",1
"Of course I meant protect Duo once you used Stand Alone, which as you say can be used right after it is played on turn 3.",1
"General opinion I've seen seems to be that Karma will still be quite strong.

But yeah, also, as others have said, even if the Karma nerf means Karma Ez isn't great anymore, that doesn't mean Ez won't be viable.  Ultimately, if your goal is to have a top tier deck, then you could be better off waiting for the post-patch meta to settle, but if you just think Ezreal looks like a really fun card you want to play with, I wouldn't worry too much.

I'm also pretty new, and I've been doing a mix of crafting champions for specific decks that look fun, and crafting ones that just look fun in general that I want to play with, and so far haven't regretted any of those crafts.  Crafted Lee Sin and Twisted Fate because I thought both looked really fun and I've loved playing with both of them so far.",1
Hahaha do you need help moving those goalposts? They look heavy ;),1
"That's true. The card is strong, but it was never overpowered. It was just one of the reasons the deck felt like a coin flip.",1
I dont think they ever wanted to make the rng based burn deck competitive. Shrooms is a meme archetype in the same way poros are.,0
"It would be easy to code trample this way. X damage, if trample y (toughness) to the creature and x - y damage to the player. Then the creature says if barrier reduce x - y to zero.",-1
Deep meditation now gives a 3-1 elusive with heimerdinger with its reduced cost. It could be good in the end,1
"Love it. Some crazy good nerfs to burn without being too much (but just enough), finally something into Karma and a crazy good buff to Vladmir (that may finally work? Who knows)",1
"You can proc plunder with just one card or any card but with deep meditation you need to use 2 spells and that’s assuming that you have the correct spells for the current situation and is willing to waste 2 spells just to draw 2 other spells

In mid game it’s easier to proc, but pilfered goods is easy to proc at all stages

There is literally a 0 mana cost spell that can proc it, and a bunch of cards that just procs plunder",1
Can you share your Decklist?,0
Woops thanks for correcting this. According to the patch notes they are looking into it which seems fine for now,1
Well I got a *cool ass* icon for masters,0
"rearguard and spiders nerf are awful

also demacia dodged big nerfs again

&#x200B;

new meta : the few decent frejlrod decks(endure/corina) which used spiders will become trash.

Demacia still tier S++",-1
He's always had a nerf. It's called purify,0
It was probably because with the nerf to burn aggro Elusives suddenly become a viable aggro deck again. And the most obnoxious thing in the world is a turn 3 Solitary Monk/Zed into Stand Alone. It was a huge problem before Rising Tides and was considered to be the brainless aggro climbing deck.,-1
legion nerf is nonsense,-1
I am in the same boat. There is a sabnitron  guy that is shitting on every balance post and  all i want is to take the patch notes and shove it to his face.,-1
"Patch notes were normally mild in Beta, and elusive were broken for a while. I expect same thing here. There are too many new cards, they will let people figure out new strategy by nerfing few broken cards. I expect burn deck to be addressed by nerfing 1-2 cards from piltover, since noxus should remain the burn option with draven.

Also, a couple of Demacia nerf will be in place",-1
Make it only work during battle or duels and reduce its cost. You can damage the unit outside battle.,-1
"Hey man, at least the Ez level up animation is pretty cool",1
No its literally identical.,0
"Fizz: Oh hi Nauti!! 

Nautilus: I HATE youuuuuu

Me: me too, Nautilus, me too.",-1
"I agree. I said the deck was a coin flip, that's bad.

I'm also saying that it only got played because there isn't a unit centered aggro deck because non-spell aggro cards tend to suck, especially one drops.",-1
It's only 2 weeks. They're staggering lor patches with league patches.,0
"> NO Bilgewater cards got adjustments

The Slotbot did. Tho no one saw that one coming. The actual problem cards from Bilgewater are on the watchlist right now.",-1
No.  The damage is just damage equal to his power.,-1
"That’s basically their reasoning for no “dust refunds”.

First they didn’t nerf the cards you purchased into oblivion like HS does a lot. Karma is still usable at 6 mana so you don’t need a refund on her.

Second you’ll be showered with so many cards that you’ll be able to build what comes next in the meta anyway.",0
"Agreed, the whole point of rearguard was that he was overstatted and even then he was exclusively played in Burn. He now looks really bad next to cithria or the pirate, he's dead now. You won't sacrifice a slot just to get blocked by a spider or omen hawk. Like you mentioned, completely useless",-1
"Freljord got really few decent 3 drop, so any buff to keeper is nice.",0
I can never tell if that’s supposed to be laughing at them or laughing at the situation. I’m sorry for assuming you got angry 😞,1
"I think the goal from the nerfs was to stop decks from being overtuned or too easy to win on without having to play it at a high level. A dedicated Karma/Lux deck is still incredibly potent, and you should still play it if it‘a fun for you. 

The only reason I would stop playing a deck is if it got gutted. I don’t believe Karma got gutted this patch, just got her numbers tweaked to raise the skill floor slightly and encourage a more thought out game plan and strategy. I’m sure you’ll be able to pull it off. 

GL&HF! 

:D",1
"They want to nerf the OTK Zed deck specifically. It feels bad to play against when they drop Zed on turn 3 after skipping turns 1-2, immediately followed by Stand Alone. Unless you have very specific answers, you lose.

Another factor is that it encourages the OTK player to mulligan aggressively for that setup and surrender if they don't get it or if their opponent has an answer.

Basically, it just feels bad to play against the deck cause there's not much of a game.",-1
Still an excessive amount of unnecessary RNG in this game.,0
"Champion exclusion is 100% indicative of how strong the deck is.

Champions are the cornerstone of progression and profitability in the game. They're intended to be the most powerful options in their respective cost brackets to push every single deck into a cost floor/ceiling.

The fact that no champion was viable for the deck states a lot.

And I never said Pet wasn't better. But not every deck runs Omen Hawk or spiders. Its a meta dependent option.",1
"That's fair.

But it's also not playable now.",1
"Because they all are big brains with their broken, net decks...",-1
Corinna has a pretty easy time against aggro. Atleast I always saw it as a free win when matched up against it unless I got really bad draws,1
I would say that the card draw going to 3 is sometimes a buff with lux on the board. And Karma is still great at turn 9-10. And the bear etc are still good with the new stats.,1
"I share pretty much the same feelings as you. However, I disagree that slotbot is hearthstone levels of RNG.  


Hearthstone's biggest issue with RNG is that it just happens, and you have to hope. Dealing a random amount of damage, or hitting a random creature is terrible. But Slotbot shuffles his stats for you at the start of your turn, and you can figure out what to do from there. His presence is important is because it's essentially the payoff card for the Bilgewater fleeting draw decks. His stats will likely even out anyway. I think this buff was good and I'm eager to try it out, not worrying about the RNG but instead enjoying the payoff.",1
A higher level crimson card that has a higher health stat line and low attack would really be helpful.,0
While it does seem oppressive Ledros isn't really that big of a deal.  They can't easily protect Ledros due to his astronomical cost.  If you're already behind on board presence by the time they start dropping him then you lost the game way before Ledros was ever a factor.  If the board states are even and you haven't punted the game already then Ledros isn't going to be able to do much by himself.  He's a pretty big trap for the person playing him.,-1
"You're comparing it to cards that you say ""cannot be used properly"" because of their slowness and then saying US would be fine without addressing how incredibly blown out the player would be because it's also easier to deal with than other slow spells. 

It would be totally unplayable.",1
This,0
Exactly. Reread what you're replying to.,0
The card isn't unplayable at fast. It's just BALANCED. The fact that you can't respond to it at all before it takes effect. And it makes the card immortal. Having it at Bust Soeed is ridiculous.,0
"It doesn't ""break a deck"".

Not knowing what cards are stolen is a serious issue. But if you're playing Unyielding Fiora, and they drew an Unyielding, its the same as that card being on the bottom of the deck.

The problem is with control decks who lose their pieces early on, but are still playing around the probability of drawing their combo pieces, while the pilfer player is playing around the fact that they never will.

Again, that's the ONLY issue.",0
Fizz leveled up with rally effects like Orange Man could be fun,1
"Burn is dead, the only midrange deck was Demacia and got nerfed really hard so that means control will completely take over. I agree with most of the changes though but overall CA should have been addressed as well because I really fear the nerfs will have an overall negative effect on the meta.

Pilfered Goods is simply wayyyyy too strong. 2 mana draw 2 cards is too good even in a vacuum. Its condition is so easy to meet its hardly a relevant trade off. It does multiple things:  
\- 2 for 1  
\- early game already outvalues your opponent because its just 2 mana  
\- Disrupts your opponent. He doesn't know which cards are still in his deck  
\- Hard counter to Freljord  
\- Suddenly you gain acces to cards and effects outside your region which can be very complementary to your own  
\- The psychological effect of having to battle your own cards

I very much believe this card can't stay this way for another month and will need a hotfix. Heimer should also get a nerf/rework.

Edit: Forgot to mention Will of Ionia is too strong of a tempo play on 4 mana which can be used defensively as offensively.",1
YES,1
"Wrong 3/1, he’s talking about Legion Rearguard, the noxus unit",-1
"Agree about Heca, but Vlad is the worst card of his own package (or at least was pre-buff, we'll see how he turns out). The only crimson card worse than him is Blood for Blood, but let's be honest, it's gonna take a lot to be worse than BfB.",-1
Draven/Jinx discard aggro will be the new Burn imo,0
" 

* LOR OFFICIAL PATCH NOTES
* [**Patch 1.2 features our first balance changes since the debut of Rising Tides, as well as a bunch of card clarity updates. For a limited time, you can also obtain a free Rainbow Poro and accompanying emote!**](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/news/patch-1-2-notes/)",1
It will still be played in aggro decks.,1
"How is stealing a card better? The cards in my deck are synergistic to my plan, the card I steal may not be and is less likely to be useful, or of maximum benefit. That's why pilfered is cheaper than standard card draw.",0
"I will repeat myself. We don't need highrolls that decide the game on **turn 3**. I don't know what's your background in card games, but if you find it normal, I hope you won't ever be hired by riot balance team.",0
Yes I am dumb and forgot slotbot and powder monkey. My mind was focused on nerfs and forgot these buffs.,0
"I agree, P&Z+N really didnt get anything that was needed",1
"Agreed, riot favors Demacia heavily, the region only play stronger units each turn also have brilliant tools like barrier and shields and s tier cards like US, purify and single combat.",1
They just nerf what is having like a high win rate and use rate like higher than anticipated so they just nerf it and see what happens,1
The only thing worthless here is your giant ice bird.,-1
"No I disagree. As time goes out we will also have better aggro tools. Burn strategies will be monitored closely and as it gets nerfed, aggro will reinvent itself into more board-oriented playstyle.

It doesn't mean swarming the board. It could be good stated minions with quick attack and/or rally and/or elusives, maybe ephemeral someday. In those cases, the best counters are not necessarily midrange minions or make it rain.

Anyway, good job on ignoring everything I just said and nitpicking on ""midrange hate"". You just wanted to share your viewpoint, but since you don't actually respond to my points, I will stop the discussion here. Bye.",0
a 4 cost 4/5 with scout? are you right in the head? it would be exact crazy op as the 4.1 badgerbear spawner. They would be adding the same card in the game while nerfing it,-1
"To die to more things overall. Not because I wanted the Rearguard to deal with it, as I'm not a Burn player.",-1
RISEEEEEEEEEEEEE AND RISEEE AGAINNNNNNNNN,0
"I'm glad that Riot didn't listened to the rising tides of crybabies crying about pilfering, yet. As a wise man said on another thread:

&#x200B;

""They don't complain because X is strong, they complain because X isn't their win condition.""

&#x200B;

Pilfered cards don't have inifinite value like Ledros, Heimer or Karma neither give you a super rush burst of tempo like burn either it isn't able to make a 4+ bodies board advantage by turn 5 like Demacia can. Pilfer cards are fine, stop crying guys.",1
"Say the player using the equally or even more broken Unyielding Spirit spell.

They are even beside each other in the watchlist notes.

Not meaning anything bu it, just find the concept ironic, lols.",-1
Same issues here. Region reward screen and the new arcade board also seems to cause issues and screen lock ups,1
"> Rearguard

Yeah they nerfed burn without nerfing burn.

Rearguard was only associated with burn, but they went and killed his chances at ever being played in another aggro deck now that even ramping 1 drops like Omen Hawk and any fucking Poro can kill him.

He already had a glaring weakness.. He can't block.",-1
so would it cost 8 mana also? because it would just be a better vengeance.,1
I am a bit disappointed to be honest. Hoped for more changes.,1
Explain?,0
"Thing is, those counters can only come with the next expansion ie. still a couple of months away",0
"I have a deck that, so far, has a 100% win rate across a dozen or so games against the burn-agro deck that is going around.

Life steal = win.",1
"Riot, please, I'm beseeching you this one time: don't nerf unyielding spirit. Just print more counters in more factions. More obliterate cards, more bounces, more detains, permanent negative stat debuffs, anything, but don't change unyielding. It's the first card in a long time that's enabled so many goofy memes. I get that it's a feels bad for so many decks when it resolves, but they should anticipate it and play around it by being more aggressive or having a stronger late game if their deck has no answers. I just wanna keep using my lux/fizz deck, and it gets absolutely dumpstered if this card gets changed at all

Edit: come on you cowards, let everyone have their fun, degenerate memes.",-1
"the nerf didnt even change anything her health was never a concern, this barely even expands what kills her.",-1
Found the burn player,0
This is real galaxy brain,0
"Ok. I understand that. but do you understand that for it to be fast it would need to be AT LEAST a 5 to even be considered ""OK to play""? And we already know they wont actually fix cards properly (3/1 rearguard? wut? the dude cant even BLOCK), I just dont see the point in deleting yet another card when the problem isnt so much the card itself as it is the design of the game.",1
Like what?,1
Is the patch up? I just updated the game but it's still the same. It even says 1.2 version in the game but nothing changed in it,0
I'm concerned about rearguard now that I've recently started playing and liking noxus aggressive playstyle. But we'll see.,1
Yup. Until there’s rewards I don’t see a point to,1
"True, it is a design error. This card goes against everything that a game wants to achieve (fun and interaction) and should just be removed, plain and simple. Really disappointing that something like this got introduced in the first place.",0
"Pre-patch they ran Draven, and the deck was actually fun with Draven's Spinning Blade management. Post patch they introduced Demolitionist and Fervor to replace Draven/Biggest Fan because they were just much faster.

The only way they could print a valid champion for the deck (which is already S-tier), would have been to print something faster than any of their aggro cards.

And that's called power creep.",1
is Ezreal's emote crying or just wet?? D:,0
"dno, patched to 1.2 on EU but none of the changes actually happened+

EDIT: from the patch notes, changes will go live around 24h after patch for some reason",0
"I’m not trying to turn it into a different game - but personally, my feedback is what would likely keep me interested in the long term rather than giving up after a few weeks. 

I’d be very surprised if the game didn’t evolve from here, it’s only been out a few weeks and while I’m really enjoying it personally I feel it needs a few notches up skill wise to make it step outside of realm of a mobile game and become a serious lifestyle game. 

Your right - I should play this game a bit more, but I’ve played a wide variety of CCG/LCGs and got a good idea what keeps me interested. Personally, deck-building should be as much fun as game play, and likewise and a big turn off for me is anything that feels like an obvious play. I’d like a handful of options every turn - which in this game I feel like I only occasionally have. 

As for neutral cards - I’d argue that most games are have regions/house/factions and nutrias cards still work thematically. My worry is that it’s too easy for 2 players to build decks that lean too heavy into something and you end up with lots of strong decks that just build towards the win condition. Look at all the decks that get nurfed/killed off in all card games - they all have that same problem.",1
Why does Ledros need a nerf?,0
"Ok they dont give back wild card like other game when they nerf cards ? I think it was worth asking the question you don’t need to downvote me I thin many people will ask this

Sometimes they give the possibility to uncaft nerfed card too",1
I'm an Ez Karma player and these changes will not kill the deck or archetype. It will still be playable and a good deck. It doesn't lose its identity.,1
"You can Purify the guardian. It loses everything and is a lousy 5/5. Still respectable statline but only a shadow of it's former glory. 


But then you have to play Demacia...",1
"I am happy for the Shen and Vlad changes, but was honestly hoping for something for Freljord...Tavern dude? Come on lol and as much as I hate the aggro burn deck, dont think the nerf to Rearguard was a good one, 1 mana 3/1 cant block? Thats a horrible card now, not to say, once again, no actual nerfs to Karma or Ez, but again on their watch list lol(Karma increase in mana wont mean much in my opinion, her skill is broken and that didnt changed, she needs a rework)",1
Agreed. This is the most generous reward system I’ve ever seen for a CCG. They make direct card purchases available and you can get a guaranteed champion card of your choice (aka a legendary) every week! I’ve been playing three weeks and can make an S-tiered deck without spending a dime. It’s generous enough I feel obligated to give them some of my money to support them.,1
"Choose your destiny:

>Yes, I can absolutely see it being used again.

vs

>I don't know whether it will actually end up seeing play

OTK was it's only usage. Now it's out of combo range and worse in general. I don't see any other potential targets, but I could be missing something.

Are you thinking of some specific usage or just acting optimistic?",0
That’s a round one knock out.,0
"Yes you just can't kill it or deal damage to it.

The Problem with Silence is that it can only target followers though.",0
"I don't think the patch has been ""turned on"" yet for people.  I also don't see it on any device.",0
They aren’t strong now but in the future they could be. Maybe new cards are added that make deck buff amazing. Then people would want to draw from the top of your deck!,1
"I like a lot if not all of these changes. Riot is off to an amazing start. 

However...the card I think that needed the most immediate change, US, wasn't touched this patch and that's disappointing. Going to be a long month...But maybe they will hotfix patch that card at some point so we don't have to wait a whole month.",0
"Generally, it's a *really* bad idea to play Karma before her level-up. It's a fantastic way to lose a game.",0
"I think what Vladimir archetype needs is a buff to Freljord survival package.

At this point only Scarmother Vrynna is okay simply because of the overwhelm keyword.

Adding some Regeneration or Overwhelm to Crimson or Survival Freljord units (probably at the cost of stat reduction to balance it) would help more Vladimir than buffing Vladimir himself.",0
"Its a bit baffling that they nerfed Meditation, which had arguably the harder condition to meet, but leave Pilfering untouched. I disagree that drawing from the enemy deck is worse. I now have to play around my own deck too, which is significant.

Black Market Merchant seems strong too. 2/2 draw 1 is basically Shadow Assassin for 1 less mana. Yes it is not an elusive, but it also has the cost reduction passive, making draw from enemy deck even better.",0
Just play ionia i all of your decks lol /s,1
Lux/Karma decks are gonna feel these nerfs so hard...,0
"They showed some new emotes on the oficial video that released with patch announcement, aside from thwe rainbow poro one, there an elise one,ezreal,draven and teemo, also a new pixel style board, are those cosmetics going to be released  with the patch aswell ?",0
"I also love their approach to balance, but they very much buffed more than one champion. Shen and Hecarim got buffed.",1
"Yeah ikr, Vi dies so easy to spells I think they should just give her a mini rework like please",1
"As someone who mainly uses Corona control: I don't much care for the Vi nerf, she will still be a scary lightning rod for removal, still trades with most things and will hardly die all that lot. Still and easy 3-of. Brood Awakening though is a different story. I often played a Hapless Aristocrat on 1, popped it on 2 by defending and played nothing, then curved into BA on 3. This was a major way to stabilize in the early game and it's no longer an option. At the same time cutting it and replacing it with actual followers will make Corona less reliable. Kinda a bummer.",-1
"I work a call center style job from home which means there's downtime between calls.  A CCG with no turn limits that still rewards the player is a FANTASTIC way to pass the time.  My favorite CCG prior to this was Elder Scrolls Legends for much the same reason.  LoR is great to play during the work day...if I still feel like playing more in my off time I'll jump into Normal or Ranked. 

Oh and if a Riot employee reads this feedback...people like me still spend money :)  I've happily bought the biggest bundle to speed up progress and enjoy my A.I. grinding more.  So please don't take this as a sign that you need to stop EXP rewards from solo play.",1
"All control decks do is 
haha sustain card go brrr
haha target card to proc ezreal go brrr
haha removal go brrr
haha deny go brrr

Play to turn 10 and win the game",1
"I think that's more of an issue with Elise having an extremely easy level up condition compared to most other champions, than having a cheaper card that assists. All she needs is three allies - what your opponent has on the field doesn't matter as much, and other champions with the potential to level up off a single spell cheaper than Brood require your opponent to have been playing minions that turn or earlier because they have much more involved conditions.",1
Barrier on scout is 2 attacks with shield in one turn. Think about it,-1
"Now that he has drain. I’m going to be playing a neverglade vlad deck for sure


Kill all my spiders with his effect and then drain 10 from their nexus",-1
"Quick attack doesn’t work when you are defending, it’s intentional",-1
"Honestly I feel like Braum is supposed to be a simple card, so I feel like they might want to avoid adding new effects to him(then again, they did that with Kata too, so it might be possible).",1
P and Z burn has been a tier 1 deck for weeks now.,0
Problem with that resolution is diluting diversity. If recall is Ionia mainly you shouldn’t toss it other places. Detains purifies ect. What makes this game so special is the lack of spells that clean up like other ccgs. It should be nerfed to not make fights one sided or the opposite. Bad card design is x 100% beats y. There should be skill expression,1
"cant see the page, not loading",0
in other CCG you are also forcwd to spend shitton of money to be somewhat competetive..,0
"Man, I wish I could suck at my job as much as the guy who writes card text for Riot lol.",0
"I have a lot of cheap removal, and a few 1-2 drops to help block should I not get the removal

Edit: I also take a few bits of healing too, stuff like health potion, kinkou infiltrator and that one barrier card that grants lifesteal. When Vlad levels up the drain helps too.

Edit 2: Also I run 3/3 Shen and Vlad, so I can pretty consistently draw them early as well.",1
"I’m still new to the game, I’ve only played about a week or so. I can craft a new champ set now and planned on crafting EZ, but now I’m not so sure. With Karma getting a nerf, will Karma/EZ still be viable? I feel like it will be, but investing in a different champ might be better.",1
They said they’re announcing something on the 29th. Here’s hoping it’d be the competitive scene.,1
"Rearguard didn't need a nerf in my opinion. it's a good card but definitely not one of the worst offenders. Boomcrew rookie at 1/3 is fair, it's still hard to remove at turn 2 but much, much more manageable to deal with. Stand alone was figured to get a nerf, same for brood. Wished to see some much needed freljord buffs and the vlad change... doesn't really do much. You still need to establish board presence while at the same time damaging your units. This is something that is not easy enough to accomplish and the payoff should be bigger. Shen is in the same boat, yes a buff to his numbers is fine but it's too hard to keep him alive. Shen would work better if he'd had an effect that he gained temporary HP every time he supported a unit with his barrier... He's way too easily removed and there are way too little cards that give barrier + there's a plethora of cheap removal.  


Unyielding should have been nerfed. Data does not mean much when it's giving people a negative experience. Same with Ezreal & pilfered goods being untouched. all of these are very much feel bad cards when you lose and it's such a hard counter to some decks that it's not even funny. Just making unyielding and pilfered goods fast cards would have worked WONDERS for a rather large amount of an unhappy player population.",-1
"Not getting the turn 3 swing with a 7/6 followed by turn 4 with Deny mana up is a pretty big hit for Elusives too.

Not to mention there are now many more tools to deal with them in most regions.",0
"dosent need to be a buff on power or health, can be something else, maybe a support skill, like give tough to the supported allie or something to match his skill in LoL, absorb part of damage that was dealt to supported allie, I dont know, anything to make him more interesting and good.",1
"Could be. Who knows. We'll know in a couple of weeks, when the meta will be probably solved where we landed.",0
"It was the intention anyways especially with the added bonus of standalone being 4 mana now thus preventing the solitary monk bullshit. In any case demacia already has a pretty big mid game with hard to deal with units. For the average demacia deck this won't be much, but for the combo that abuses it this is a fair nerf tbh. Also let's not forget that ranger/bear are waaaaaaaaaaaay too versatile and offers too much value.",1
Well you’re going to be happy lol.,1
I guess I'll see after a month. I've been playing 3 hours a day though and I barely have any champions.,1
It does say they are watching deck stealing but until next patch you get to watch me steal more of your precious freljord buffed cards mwhahahahah.,0
"Pretty much every statement I've read has been the opposite (vlad completely irrelevant, shen potentially useful, probably both still fall short).",1
How does the nerf to Vi and Badger affect this particular deck? Asking since they're the cornerstones of the deck.,0
"Badger and Grizzled getting nerf which both are staple in Quinn MF deck.
And Scout Moose card getting buffed, although the card isn't always included in the deck, with this buff the card will probably seen some play (or not).
The deck is still strong imo, it's basically Demacia Bannerman but with little bit of Bilgewater splashed on.",1
"People just using her for the level up will drop her then, but Karma gives far more value from dropping her early. She generates random spells in her unlevelled form that provide great utility as your opponent now has to play around spells that weren't even in your deck. Delaying how early she comes out means fewer random spells for her player and more options for her opponent to deal with her.",1
Some decks have like a 90-100% winrate against it. Some other decks struggle and it is a flip coin. A lot of the time it just comes down what 1-2 cards the burn deck has left in their hand and if you can survive that you win.,1
Unyielding is a burst speed spell. You can't deny it.,0
"Not including champions has nothing to do with how strong they are.

Speed certainly has an impact, but regardless of how fast it is, it still needs to actually be balanced. Which it probably currently isn't, considering it's nearly absent outside of 1 specific deck that's being nerfed.

Pet is better in general. It can block, and much more importantly it can actually get past as much as a puny little omen hawk. Even if rearguard can sometimes still be useful, being absolutely useless if there's a single token on the enemy side should be more than enough to make the card redundant.",0
"Rearguard nerf makes sense since it puts it in line with Pet. As a 1 drop.

For a further nerf, they should either nerf Demolitionist/Disciple, or change Get Excited to unit only.",0
Vlad’s playstyle focusing a lot on board control you’d imagine he’d deal 1 to all enemies too :sigh: Feels like a weird step in the wrong direction with this buff but anything is welcome at this point,1
"burn or at least all in agro will always be part of the meta in one way or another, but at least now it has way more counterplay making it not so toxic.",0
"Why do you say that? The new answers to him don't come until 5 mana .... being withering wail and chempunk shredder.

Mystic shot already kills him. I guess now vile feast does too and that's cheap ...",-1
"It is still going to be decent in round 1 when the enemy gets nothing out or when he gets some 2 Mana units out. At worst you trade and 2 enemy units get +1/+1. So the risk/reward is still in an ok spot.

A 3/1 for 1 Mana that you never want to block with anyways is still ok. The other option to get it down to a 2/1 that can block would have been even worse for aggro.

The could remove the can't block. But it wouldn't change a ton",-1
Well stealing from top or bottom doesnt actually affect anything. The probabilities remain the same.,0
What would make him better?,1
"Agree. Its easy to say ""Just play will of ionia when she has undying spirit"" Well not every deck got splash of Ionia in them. There is other solutions too, but they arent permanent. Frostbite lasts 1 turn, while she can still block / attack without any problems because she is unkillable for the rest of the game.",0
Legion Rearfucked,0
"Welp. I ran none of these so that explains things.  
I need a deck with more tools to deal with all that it seems, can't go just for board control and heals. Shame, I like my 12/10 Sentries or Tuskraider 10/10+'s lategame.",0
"Well it doesn’t make sense to most people, which is why most people want it changed. LoR is not MTG (which is a good thing)",1
Burn will become unplayable. They basically got 2 good units nerfed into unplayability.,1
"And that combined with the drawing from top mechanic means that pilfered goods actually helps your enemy at finding a champion, which is pretty significant for a decent amount of decks.",1
I interpret his comment as sarcasm. You're not really playing un-evolved Karma on curve usually. The deck's wincon is getting both an evolved lux and karma on board and going pewpew pewpew pewpew with the lasers,-1

"Awesome - thanks, and amazing too see you folks are an active part of the community! Some other (more positive feedback) I’m a fairly active in-person card game player but due to the obvious this has been a great game to discover to get my regular fix. I appreciative how close this game is to a physical card game and not too much like a video game.

I’ve tried to turn a lot of other players too it - the turn structure and timing is a lot like the other games I’ve mentioned and really make for tons of decisions space.",1
"Uh no. My klepto deck runs both and pilfered goods can be a pita to trigger properly plus it's not uncommon to get trash out of your opponents deck, toss 4 being a god awful card for me.

On the other hand getting the 2 mana discount on deep meditation is so easy, my deck is built around being able to burst 2 spells cheaply if I need, one of which is pilfered goods.

3 mana draw 2 from my deck is way better than 2 mana plunder draw 2 from theirs.",1
"I don't think any sane person plays Karma on turn 5 lol.
I think the nerf intent is to leave less mana for a Deny or Will.
So you will have to play it one turn later (as in turn 7 in your case).",1
"I gave examples of decks that beat Karma/Ez. But pretty much any aggro deck beats it.

It might be nerfed eventually, we'll see. But Lux Karma was hurt by about 3 nerfs this patch.",0
"Well, prior to this most Vlad decks were better without actualy running Vlad.",1
We wont miss them,0
Holy smokes did not expected a response from the dev team. Love the changes love the game and thank you for taking the time to chime in!,1
Nerfs to it tomorrow tho,0
"just means gotta be a bit smarter with it wont hurt it much honestly outside of some battle situations

most damage spells are fast so just wait until they play theirs first",1
You will never see rearguard played again.,0
Yeah instalose afeter turn 7 pretty balanced,1
I'm F2P and I don't really ever feel like I'm unable to play the decks I want.  In the beginning though I definitely had to do research into what regions I wanted to play most a do their region rewards first.  But with expeditions and the weekly vault getting cards is easier than other games.,1
I'm climbing with a Sejuani deck. Freljord is working really nicely for me right now.,1
"Eating your own dudes and not having enough life left without the blockers was absolutely something that could happen to a Vlad deck.

This isn't going to make Vlad decks t1 or anything because hurting your own dudes comes with inherent disadvantages but it is an appreciable buff that will come up in actual game play.",0
I honestly did not feel like Rearguard was that strong (relative to other cards) though. Feels like he got nerfed because they needed to nerf something in Noxus for a second P&Z Burn nerf.,1
1 power 1 cost cards just got a huge boost in usability now that they can trade against a rearguard. Thank god.,1
"I'm done editing it, my phone posted it early.",0
"I think a yasuo draw card would go a long way. Similar to nautilus or the other rising tide characters, yasuo doesn't need a ship persay, but he is very much a lone wanderer. Yasuo decks die or don't do much without him, he is a key component but only have 3 in a deck is worrisome. I think there are a couple options. 

* Steel tempest: Cost 3, stun an attacking enemy, shuffle a 2 cost steel tempest in deck. After casting 3 steel tempests, draw a yasuo. 

Or

* Flute of the wanderer = cost 3 slow, on next round start, draw a yasuo. 

The former is when you are going through your deck trying to find your key card, steel tempest isn't very cost effective since it's ONLY a defensive spell, isn't burst, and is high cost. The 3 cast thing will add flavor and theme to yasuo while you stay alive to get your champion. 

The latter is a slow spell that doesn't work til next round so your opponent has an idea of what's to come but guarantees a particular draw for the user. Weaker but specific use like entreant.",-1
"In terms of neutral cards, I’d be happy to see some neutral utility cards - some cheap draw or mana, or some passive effects that could make a bit more use of cards in the field. 

Im coming from the perspective of someone that goes for heavier and heavier games - I personally prefer more depth and strategy over quick thematic games - so, again take from that what you will. I think a few neutral cards would open up deck building a lot - especially some draw. Personally I find I’m top-decking quite a lot (might be my play-style) and it’s then RNG if I pull something game winning or not.",1
"You're mistaking the ability to win a game where a certain card was played, or killing a follower, with ""beating a card"".

You were literally never beating Grizzled Ranger as it was played. There was no single 1-4 drop that could get rid of Grizzled Ranger in a valuable way. It always traded into at least 2 cards.

Again, everyone knew he was overstatted. Everyone's said it since his reveal. We all knew the meta would be dominated by Grizzled Ranger. Every pro player said how great this card is, and Riot likely knew it, but just shipped it anyway. Hell, they implemented the same change that EVERYONE predicted.

""Limited testing"" doesn't really apply as an excuse, when literally every single person who saw the card knew it was going to be the strongest card in the expansion on its reveal.",-1
"*silently upvote, because i play this deck*",1
I feel like with burn now that the units are more easily taken out some of that needed removal can be used as aggression against them. Also a couple heals can go a long way especially if they are more forced to single use damage as in the case of spells,-1
"I agree. While card stealing can be a fun concept to play with  (for a pirate region like Bilgewater) - it sure is toxic to play against. Especially when they steal some of your main combo tools and use it against you!

Pilfered Goods should at the very least cost 3 mana. But no, it's a 2 mana draw 2 from YOUR opponent's deck so you can draw 5 cards on turn 3 with BM merchant (warning shot + banked mana)",1
His damage,-1
Oooo good call,1
Welp time to break out Lee Sin,-1
"I mean, Rookie is still a good card even at 1/3. You should still be able to get at least 4 unblockable burn damage out of it most times.",0
"I disagree with you given that almost everyone singled out the Rookie as the most problematic card, but I understand your thought process.",-1
"People think that this doesn't make it much weaker, but makes it much healthier as you then know what cards to play around. The bad thing about pilfer is that, as stated in the patch notes, you don't know what cards they could possibly have. By seeing certain champs and by the rest of the cards that they've played, most players will know about 95% of the cards in your opponent's deck or can at least make inferences about what is in their deck. If they pilfer you, you either have to play around every card in your own deck and sometimes still not be prepared for it, or find it not worth playing around at all and just hope they get cards that don't work well with their deck. Also sometimes you are hoping to draw a specific card in your deck to turn the game around, like say ruination or maybe a detain or something for unyielding spirit, only for it to be in your opponent's hand all along and you have no idea while playing for an out that isn't there. Riot has stated that they want LoR to be low luck, high interactivity and high skill. Pilfer showing what cards they drew from your deck will greatly increase how healthy the mechanic is since you then know ""Ah, he drew this card from my deck that isn't generally in his deck. I will play around X card now"" and also ""Ah it sucks that this isn't in my deck, but at least I know it isn't"".",1
"Angry horse used to be way over the top when he had 6 health because he was far too difficult to remove and usually got to attack twice without some extraordinary investment from the other player.

Putting him at 5 hp was good.  


Only reason he kind of stopped being played is because people figured out how strong stuff like bannerman and karma was after he stopped being oppressive with 6 health. Then the expansion happened and had so many outright broken cards (some of which now got nerfed) that the resulting power creep made half the existing champs and cards in the game uncompetitive.

They  need to do a lot more nerfs to the new cards if they want to stop power creep from shitting on the game and stop it from becoming another heartstone.",-1
"Oh No RiTo NeRfEd ThE oNlY dEcK i WaS CaPaBlE tO PiLoT ReEeEeE. U can't just assume this change will push it out of the meta entirely. How i see this change is Riot giving us ways to actually counter burn other then being forced to tech in SI.  Boom crew rookie nerf was definietly neccesary, tho i dont understand the nerf on the 3/2. Time will show, just wait and see.",-1
"This mainly was aimed on people which keep 3 spell mana on turn 2, then play some stuff like fiora or zed(?)(really don't remember his cost rn) in turn 3 and give it +3+3 in the same turn.",1
I don’t think unyielding spirit would have been unplayable at fast speed. Highly disappointed at the lack of a nerf to that card.,-1
"Look at the idiot convention over here.

The card is unplayable at fast without the cost need.

Go on kill the card.",-1
I like some of the lil changes here n there and felt like they were good calls especially Shen. Felt like he could only be playable if his atk was buffed before he hit the board.,1
"seems burn deck still gonna be alive and well,probably just decreased play rate.",1
She may still be usable in Corina control.,0

"New player looking for some help

I’ve been playing for a few weeks and I’ve just started to really enjoy the game, playing hearthstone less and LoR more. I decided to craft my first deck today and settled on one that I found particularly interesting (CECAEAQCAMEQEAQAAMEQIAICAICCSOIEAEAA6GRBFIAQCAQAAEBACAICGEAQEAAF).

It’s a Lux/Karma deck that I spent just about all the resources I’d collected to craft. I played 2 games, had a blast, went to work and when I got home I discovered a good chunk of this deck was nerfed. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t see a way to “disenchant” nerfed cards for wildcards or shards, and even if I could I’m not sure it’s worth it since I crafted a lot of cards that weren’t nerfed. My question is: Is the deck still viable? Should I look into the possibility of getting cards refunded?",1
"Is there any way to counter Unyielding Spirit? Apart from having an Ionian deck and recall/ stunning the enemy Fiora into oblivion or using a Freljord deck and Frostbiting them every turn I can’t seem to find any way.

I also forgot purify/ having my own unyielding ally",0
"To be honest making Rearguard 4/1 instead of just taking his 1 health would be way better.

  
That would make him high risk high reward card that can be stoped by anything, which can benefit from Drummer or Drummer + Gloryseeker combo.  


Now its just dead card.",1
"The point of Vi is to give the enemy hard choices. Either you play a big minion, which kills her but she will also likely kill with her high attack, or you play several small minions, which she will kill one by one then hit the Nexus for 5 each time. But at least you get to attack back with your multiple small minions. 

If you give her overwhelm by default, that would make her nexus strike ability too strong and similar to Lee Sin's level 2.

Regarding synergy, Vi is problematic because her buff requirement is barely a requirement. You're going to play cards anyway, that's what the game is about. That's why you see her played as the only 3 P&Z cards in an otherwise pure Demacia deck.

Compare Vi with Vlad. You have to jump through hoops to level up Vlad, and you have to attack with a full board just to get that extra 5 nexus damage. Which is really hard to do considering your other units are most likely dead or dying because you're trying to level up Vlad while defending to buy you time. And then, after that bloody attack, if the game isn't over you'll still have to worry about defending. 

Vi on the other hand levels up as you go about your business, especially with her champ spell, then she can hook a small minion and do 5 nexus damage on her own.",-1
"How do you have so many champions? I have been playing a ton but it is seemingly impossible to get the champions I need to build meta decks.

"Yeah good point, we'll see what riot does with him. He should get a buff one day, but maybe they just like him at meme tier.",1
"Yep, karma deserved way more",0
"With a game that re-balances as aggressively as this one, this feels pretty bad. I'm a fairly new player and spent a week or two accruing wild cards. By the time I felt I could probably invest in something good, I was thinking ""and then the deck I'm able to make will get nerfed..."" I didn't know how the nerfing refund system worked/if it existed, but guessed correctly that it was non-existent it seems. And once I redeem wildcards, I don't even have the option to get rid of the cards I crafted for shards or anything if I decide they aren't good anymore and I'd be willing to take the value hit.

I know this sub is reluctant to do anything but effusively praise this game's monetization model, and I do think it's leagues above Hearthstone's, but the nerf forgiveness system really leaves me cold and could be better.",1
You must not play ranked then.,0
"It's not as simple. If you change it to fast and maintain its cost, is unplayable for the amount of answers your opponent can have for a commitment of 8 mana play. Then if you make it cheaper, then you risk it being in play much earlier, where your opponent will have less ways of dealing with it.

Idk why the downvotes. I see no counter arguments to my statement, huh? 
Guess the Reddit Balance TeamTM strikes again",-1
"I couldn't figure out how to reply to your comment but yes, most of reddit tends to underestimate 1 hp/dmg/mana changes.

"Jinx discard is only hurting because Noxus burn is so much faster. Most lists dont even run Rearguard, and Boomcrew gets discarded by the deck pretty frequently if it isnt played on curve.",-1
"Maybe it's just me but I don't see these changes tuning down burn much or at all, Imo burns actual problem is in all of it's direct damage not the followers. How one could go about chilling that out without butchering it, idk? but as someone who consistently answers rearguard turn one I didn't and don't see him as an issue. Boomcrew kept his unblockable 2 damage and lost one health, He will likely still be 2 mana for 4 Nexus damage :/ Crimson Disciple is unchanged and also consistently pushed 4-6 direct damage. I think the only thing getting nerfed about burn will be it's play rate until people realize it's hardly nerfed.  


On a side note I considered Precious Pet far more powerful than Rearguard, if you're not playing SI to Vilefeast him he'll use that fearsome tag to bash face until you can drop a 3 power unit.",-1
"3+1-4, I'm afraid. It's a lump sum. And IIRC it does hit all allies  for 2. So it's not good with kegs.",-1
"You should consider having tavern keepers when the patch comes into effect as they will be 3/3s with heal 3 and Boom Crew Rookies will be 1/3s, which will decimate their damage per turn and make them run out of cards very rapidly. Also Rearguards will be 3/1s, so you can safely throw a 1/1 at them (or vile feast)",-1
"Demacia was hit hard in Expeditions. I think it is healthy for the format - though it was a easy way to get 5-7 wins consistently. 

The burn nerfs are fine but I hope they don't kill it too much as I think such decks are necessery to keep overly greedy decks in check. Though cards like Boomcrew rookie was almost guarenteed to deal 4-5 damage playing on T2.

I absolutely love that they buff bad cards like Slotbot, Monkey Idol, Longtooth etc.",1
"So there are some significant nerfs coming for PZ/Noxus burn decks, but also to Vi and Deep Meditation. Can't wait to see how this impacts Heimerdinger, since he's my favorite champion to play by far. 

One thing I notice is that Deep Meditation might be *more* beneficial for the Donger now, since meeting the prior-turn requirement turns it into one of those Elusive-turret-generating 3-cost spells -- which fits the apparent intended use for the card to be a staple of spell-focused decks instead of a standard insert into Ionia decks in general.",1
He is pretty lack luster but I think they didn't touch him yet because he might be too new. So who knows he might end up being reworked.,0
I think Fast and Slow is enough. Theres no need for burst. The game does not need no-response spells.,0
Mate control cant dominate the meta if current Ezreal exists. Nuff said.,0
"It's a nerf to freljord deck construction.  Babbling Bjerg pulls a 5+ power unit out of your deck.  You can construct your deck so the only creatures that hit that threshold are stuff like tryndamere and other power cards, so now bjerg is a reliable tutor.  With greathorn at this power level, you either have to not run him, or reduce the reliability of Bjerg to get you the card you want.",1
"Vi and Brood Awakening’s nerfs are necessary to keep Corina Control decks from running amok, especially with PnZ Noxus burn and Bannerman both nerfed. 

I actually think Vlad’s and Kindly Tavernkeeper’s buffs will push Braun and Vlad self damage deck to viability. Previously it would die to aggro before u can set up your mid game payoff with Vlad and Scarmother.",-1
"It cant block, so it wont trade favourably by default. And now its just Legion Infiltrator, but way worse, and an awful T1 play.",-1
"I agree with both bullet points.

I don’t think it’s possible or necessary to nerf the value of the steal package.

Having your cards stolen sucks especially with buffs.

Also I agree with your analysis though I would postulate not every deck can afford to wait to find out what the opponent stole and some decks literally can’t afford to play around their fringe or powerful cards.

If you are playing demacia you can’t play around your opponent stealing Single Combat which means if they ever have the nuts you often straight lose... to your own card.

That’s a feelsbadman.",0
"As far as I recall, most Lucian/X (Zed, Quinn, Vi, Garen) are just faster versions of the same midrange deck (Bannerman).

"Jinx Draven was the standard aggro deck that kept in check control decks. That in itself means it was not ""shitty"" by any means.

By opportunities of counterplay, I mean opportunities of counterplay. Interactivity is what creates interesting situations / decisions, which in turn provide a way for skill and experience to matter. Board-oriented damage allows some interactivity. Burn spells, much less so. Elusives is in between. 

Same refrain ? Yes. Because that **is** a problem.

As for your midrange hate, by essence, midrange decks will regain the board against aggro. They are built around establishing and sustaining board presence, while aggro will typically forego the latter to focus on Nexus damage. There is a middle term to be found, and Riot is on the right path I would say.",-1
"Seems like burn decks are still really strong. It’s those 2-damage burns that actually kills you ie the Crimson Disciple, Imperial Demolitionist, that caustic cask guy and grenadier. Also their direct damage spells like mystic, get excited and gotcha. IMHO, it’ll still be an oppressive deck.",0
"Demacia, Ionia, and SI clearly can play around a fast speed version...Freljord has none I can think of... PnZ and Noxus can do 3 damage which usually isn’t enough... and BW has the anchor in deep and Scrapshot which isn’t a viable spell.

I am new though so I may not be thinking of all of them. Permanent invulnerability should not be a thing for anyone regardless of fast speed answers.",0

Still able to trade up, extra aggresive,  but without the tankiness it used to have.",0

other change just grant it barrier at the start of round.",0
"Or ""Deal 2 damage to target unit or 1 damage to the enemy Nexus.""",-1
Booooo,0
It's also one of those things where they could now have cards in their hand that you knew at the beginning of the game they couldn't have before. If they're playing Bilgewater SI and then they steal 2 of my cards now what? Am I supposed to play around all the good cards in 4 different regions? It puts a lot of pressure on the player getting stolen from and it's a fairly low cost to do so.,0
Maybe it could work for an attack turn and a defense turn?,-1
"I think the card needed to be strong along with Demolotionist because the other two drops were mediocre (especially Grenadier). I think the power level of the one drops between factions is also a problem, because cards like Omen Hawk shouldn't compete as easily as aggro one drops while giving off value.

The cherry on the top were the burn spells, of which all are pretty good but not overpowered.",1
"mobile player here! Yeah me too, I've had to exit multiple times to make the 3rd option show up. Also, after the patch I am now lagging so hard when drafting.",0
I think people will just put Teemo in to replace the rear guard and keep boomcrew rookie in. The downsides of this are that you can't play more than 1 Teemo and the rookie is easier to kill but I don't think these downsides are enough to hurt it much at all.,-1

"No. Pilfered Goods is fine.

"Agreed 100%

And they've let us know what's on their mind with Unyielding Spirit, Plunder... I'm guessing that since the patch is still way too fresh they're waiting for more data and to find better alternatives to balance than just to change numbers.

">6 would still be too good and the card needs some kind of counter play.

We literally just took it from burst to on the stack. That's as much counterplay as you can get in this game.

>Cost 6 would allow you to use it on turn 3-4 on a targets such as  Zed/Fiora/Elise/Lucian/Teemo/Etc. if you forced your opponent to use his  resources to kill it before it happened.

Okay lets say the player goes Pass, Pass, Zed (you can remove it right now), Unyielding spirit (They have 1 mana) you can counter the stack to chain kill it.

Which means you can punish proactive plays.

Now lets say the player goes Pass, Pass, Zed... And the player keeps attacking with Zed, NEVER taps below 8 mana and you somehow manage to not kill Zed or them.

Do you really think that is realistic. Punishing an 8 mana float IS game winning in some decks if not a huge tempo play in others.

>9 cost would also help (but not enough) and cost 10 would kill the card  altogether (Like Warmother's Call, which is still powerful but also  quite powerful and slow so pretty much no one plays it).

Warmother's Call has no ""counterplay"" other than deny. 0 in 6 of 7 regions literally can not interact with the card after it is played and yet the card isn't play like you said because it is too slow.

>If you're playing Demacia with Ionia (as an example) you'll need a total of 12 mana to play it with a deny, which can be achieved at turn 9 and that's not that crazy if you ask me

You wouldn't play this with deny backup. you would play this when your opponent is tapped out of removal. A single Single Combat for 2 mana is all it takes to crush Unyielding you can't afford to wait that long and give the opponent that much flexibility.

>for the power that card gives you and if they deny it means you forced  your opponent to waste a resource on it, which allows you to use your  remaining mana for other things too.

If your opponent denies an 8 mana play they are ""winning"" you aren't wasting their anything. If you deny the deny then you just tapped out while they have 5-8 mana to kill your unit. Almost every single deck that is competitive could do that.

>Another take (which is something I've writing a lot lately) is to limit  the effects of Unyielding Spirit during combat... which would limit the  card but would make ""more sense"".

Riot and the LoR team clearly don't like overly complex design. I think the most likely change is a change to 7 mana at fast or 6 mana at slow.. maybe 2 more patch cycles to seeing zero play and they will buff it down one more mana at either speed.

PS Riot don't make it slow speed or the card is going to be even more hard to balance.",-1

"\>***unyielding spirit*** 

What would the mana cost be adjusted to if this was moved to fast speed?

If the answer is there would be no change because making a unit invulnerable is so vastly valuable that allowing it earlier than turn 5 would be game breaking, then the current card isn't balanced properly.

But the real problem with the card is it's oppressive interactions with certain cards. An invulnerable unit should have the downside of not being buffable, an invulnerable unit shouldn't be able to be copied, or at best the copies shouldn't be invulnerable.

Allowing these interactions makes the card unfun because there is no counterplay other than running Ionia or being a deep deck.

The target card if it's at burst, should be a constant value generator, not a game-ender. You cannot counterplay 3 invulnerable units. And the answer to only vsing 1 invulnerable unit, play Ionia.",1

"I am so incredibly confused at what Vi is supposed to do at this point. One of her strengths was trading positive with 5 attack units, which are usually around 5 mana. Tough suggests she should challenge low attack units, but her power makes it seem like she should challenge big units, but she lacks any survivability tools on her own to pull that off. 

&#x200B;

So if we assume that she should use tough and champions should be used in a way that they stay on board, she should be challenging low attack units. This also usually means they have low health, which makes her 10 attack overkill at best and overwhelm would frequently be better than the 5 nexus damage strike effect. Pretty much the only exception is Braum, which would make Vi extremely specifically an anti-Braum champion. Countering one specific champion should never be a champion's purpose or identity.

&#x200B;

So what decks ""synergize with her kit"" and what even is her kit? Barrier and Unyielding Spirit, like she is a Fiora that deals nexus damage instead of alternative win condition? Noxus PNZ in a very slow nexus damage deck with some of the extremely few ways to give her overwhelm? She really needs some way to leverage her attack since right now she pretty much just chump blocks herself and waits for a critical moment to trade with something big.",1

"> An unplayable hapless sits in your hand while the opponent second guesses every play wondering if you got their one of vengeance or one of their two atrocities

Not really because your opponent still has to play the game. If they drew a hapless they aren't going to be representing like they have a vengeance. They aren't going to be making sure they stay above 7 mana for my They Who Endure, so in a couple of turns I'll be able to say for certain that they didn't get my vengeance. Atrocity would work the same way. 

And you can't bluff that either because you don't know what I have in my deck, you only know the cards you've drawn. If you're representing like you have Vengeance and I have it in my hand you're fucked because I'm let you keep bluffing the Vengeance until I can kill you.

> Playing against twice the amount of pool of cards is worth the synergy value no?

I do agree with that I just don't agree that drawing 2 cards from your opponents deck via Pilfered Goods is better than using the (now 3 mana) discounted Deep Meditation to draw 2 spells out of your deck. Cards in your deck are inherently more valuable to you than cards in your opponents deck. And even when you factor in that I have to slow play for a couple turns to confirm the outs to my board in my own deck aren't cards you drew it still wouldn't be better.

All that being said I do think we're probably agreeing on most of what the nerfs to the steal package should be.

1. It should show you what cards they took. The fact that it doesn't is pretty unfair because for 2 mana and 1 nexus damage they can stall me for 2 turns while I figure out whether the cards you took from me are useful or not.

2. It should take from bottom of deck and not top. You never made that argument ever but Frejlord is weak enough as it is without getting additionally getting its win conditions taken out of their deck.",1
"It's a difference between nerfing the top 10% or buffing the other 90%, there's a hard way and an easy way of doing things

"Hey, I understand this question so much, as I was in a similar position just over a month ago. I do not, however, agree with the people responding below you! I don't think it's necessary to look up tier 1 and tier 2 decks to craft. Everyone is different and everyone enjoys the game differently. What people are suggesting is the fastest way to climb, not necessarily the best way to enjoy the game.

With that having said, this is what I did when I started.

In the beginning I collected a few champions of my own. After a while when I started getting bored/losing with the standard decks, I just went to my collection and checked out which champions I had. With that I chose the champions that seemed the coolest which I had a few of (although 1 is enough). I just made a combination of champions I had that would seem cool and viable together, which will automatically get you two regions. Then from there I just start adding cards that I already have unlocked that seem pretty good. You can spend a few wildcards here and there, but not too much.

This kept me busy for at least another week. Since the game is new, it's still fairly easy to win this way, be it normals (normals also have MMR, look it up if you don't know what I'm saying) or ranked.

After this gets boring, it was time for me to move on to the next step; which is to commit to a popular deck that has been proven as a very good deck! There are multiple sources/streamers you can check out, but I would personally recommend MegaMogwai. He just has an overall very awesome attitude towards the game and likes building decks that are not standard practice. Another good source is SwimStrim.

From them I just check out which decks they have built (I only look at champions, so I don't get overwhelmed) and then I decide which one to commit to. At this point you should be able to build at least 90% of the deck with wildcards and shards. I chose Yasuo myself, as that looked like a very interesting champion that not too many people play. I was very happy with my choice, as I played the deck for at least a month! If you, however, do not like the deck, then you will be ready to build a similar deck (e.g. a deck with half the same champions for example) in a week. It goes really fast in this game!

"> His issue in beta was the fact that his horses would swing for 6 damage without any prior set up.

Oh, so that's why they nerfed his Health, which has nothing to do with his adds dealing 6 damage.

> Hitting him to 5 health was overkill and completely removed him from the meta. 

Let's just conveniently forget that Rising Tides saw the addition of a myriad of new cards and other changes that almost indubitably play a big part in the prevalence of any given deck.

> I would love to see him with his original statline and where he is at currently.

I wouldn't. Buff other Ephemeral-oriented cards, rather than going full Hecarim-powerhouse like he used to be.

> I feel he is in a great spot and doesn’t need much change other than returning him to his former 6 hp glory that he truly deserves.

I don't know if you're a Hecarim main on League of Legends or something but no, he doesn't ""deserve"" to be at 6 Health. He's fine at 5 Health. There are other ways you can make his decks - and thus him - more playable.

> however a 6 mana unit with 5hp has some very serious implications. It means he cannot swing into 5 drop units effectively which is the main issue with plying hecarim currently (especially because Vi exists)

Vi who got nerfed and who, now with her nerf and Hecarim's buff, can only trade up against Hecarim and not win a trade without help?

Yeah, I'm okay with that. Hecarim's Attack is far more intimidating, especially when properly combined with Ephemeral synergies like Shark Chariots. Or if you've attacked enough with Ephemerals before, levelled up Hecarim.

That's where I'd like to see things go. Ephemerals really struggle to establish any kind of board because half of it vanishes at the end of the round anyway. Hecarim always attacks at-disadvantage because every turn preceding his play has been ineffective versus the opponent's.

So buff the early game, and it buffs Hecarim. Seems straight-forward enough to me.",-1

No one and I mean literally no one runs the SI 1/1 you're talking about it. It's too slow and offers nothing in later turns. It needs to be a weak card because 3 damage on a conditionaless 1 mana drop, in a deck that is focused on a shitton of aggro, provided very consistent turn 1 and 3 damage. Sure, it can't block..so what? They don't care about blocking.

Now it can actually be reliably blocked, which reduces the ability for burn to just burst you down. It'll get replaced and needs to be. It's a bad card, yes...but it needs to be bad.",-1
It used to be 6 mana originally and was buffed to 5 mana because it saw zero play. Even spider decks refused to play it because it was so bad at 6 mana.,-1
I'm arguing for a dozen different ways to play that are all viable and don't crush each other out definitively,0
"Yes, thank you, I'm aware that my feelings didn't match their analytical data *since that was the entire reason I brought it up.*

Regardless, statistics can lie. In this case, I suspect Rearguard's winrate when dropped on turn one is inflated due to the other options in the deck. When you're playing against something like Freljord, you mulligan for Rearguard because you know their Omen Hawk can't kill it. When you play against Demacia, you mulligan for Legion Saboteur or Precious Pet because they have 1-drops that can trade with Rearguard. Thus, you get a situation where dropping Rearguard on turn 1 has a high winrate while Rearguard isn't actually OP.

That was my point. Grizzled Ranger, Badgerbear, Vi, Karma, etc. have all felt consistently overpowered over time. Rearguard has seen play since beta, but has never been considered to be a problem by the majority of the community afaik. But the only other option they really had to nerf Noxus was Legion Grenadier, and I'm guessing they chose otherwise for some reason.

Wouldn't surprise me if Rearguard just stops seeing play now. A 3/1 that can't block and dies to anything does not seem good.",1
"I think it is smaller than it seems, karma is a 10 mana unit anyways, and yeah there will be 1 mana less to work with karma but honestly doesnt change shit, just like the rekindler nerf. If we see less karma, it will be more because of the meta change, not the 1 mana nerf",1
"It's pretty odd to get no reimbursement for nerfed cards. Both Hearthstone and Magic Arena give a lot of your investment back when they nerf cards you own. During beta it's one thing, but now that we're in full release, people will be turned off by having their cards downgraded with zero reimbursement.",0
My man!,0
"> don't think any sane person plays Karma on turn 5 lol. I think the nerf intent is to leave less mana for a Deny or Will. 

Especially cause good players rarely played her before turn 10.     With 13 mana old Karma left you with 8 meaning 2 will/deny or 1 unyielding could be played but with the nerf you are left at 7. It is a significant change but doable to play around.",1
Was Stand Alone nerf really needed?,0
"Sorry, you may have misunderstood.

>There was no single 1-4 drop that could get rid of Grizzled Ranger in a valuable way. It always traded into at least 2 cards.

I was just alerting to the fact that there is two which trade evenly with it. That's all.",-1
"Don't worry, 1 hp reduction won't make her unplayable, she was super busted.",1
"If pilfered cards actually came from the bottom of your deck, a lot of people would, or at least should, stop complaining. I would personally like that change. (OR the change someone else suggested, where both players know what was stolen, though that gives much less incentive to play pilfer decks I guess)

But what you said isn't entirely true, as with cards like Babbling Bjerg, Deep Meditation, and others, you can draw things that are not on top of your deck. So removing something from your deck entirely IS a little worse than putting it at the bottom. Ultimately, there's no change they can make to fix that, that's just an inherent part of the mechanic. 

It's not as frustrating as a lot of people are saying, but the mana cost for Pilfered goods is just stupid low in my opinion.",-1
Can you give your reasoning? None of the cards changed effect the deck that much.,0
"Hecarim is the only counter example I can think of, he got hit HARD",0
"Thats not an insult, its straight up facts: thats the reason you deserve the downvotes you got.",1
You’d be locking him into those specific units more than he already is.,0
Let's balance a deck that has low cost and high damage output by not increasing cost or lowering damage output. That seems about right.,-1
"I don't understand rito's logic behind nerfing Stand-Alone. Demacia is oppressive because of Badger bear and Grizzled Ranger, alone with invincible Fiora, not stand alone.
 Only Zed deck runs stand alone , and Zed deck is not the problem with Demacia",-1
"A big part of his strength wasn't against removal, but in synergy with your own cards. Transfusion or demolitionist bring able to ping it and still survive is significant.",1
Those are literally two differences.,0
"I hope I am commenting this on the right section but could you please make that card ""follower only"" like ""purify"" from the demacia region?? 

This would be a huge nerf to the card AND Fiora. Which I think it's a pretty efficient change. 

There's currently no counterplay to fiora when she has unyielding spirit unless the opponent has a card that can recall the enemy unit. And when fiora has unyielding spirit, theres just absolutely no counter play, since she has challenge and can't die.",1
"Sure, but it still wasn't a small nerf.  They nerfed him into the ground so that he wasn't in any competitive decks anymore.",0
It's basically gutted now though. Seems like a terrible card. I would've preferred to see it changed to 2/2 or something than making it 4 mana.,0
"Eh there's nothing brutal about it, you can get champions easily through the tracks and vaults now. Much, much easier than getting legends in HS, by like a mile. Not to mention the 7 day new player bonus that already gets you like 3.",1
"I'm not even a agro player jesus fucking christ. I thought the goal here is to make every card viable.

Having 3/1 who cant block is not viable. Instead of killing a card find a place for that card somewhere else.

Whole fucking reddit feels butthurt because of this deck and all of u got some ptsd when anyone calls bad nerf a bad nerf.",-1
"As a Heimer Vi player, the nerf to Deep Meditation seems interesting. Now there's another way to generate another Elusive Unit.",1
"rearguard nerf is incredibly clumsy, i'd much rather have preferred the crimson 2/3 getting nerfed to 2/2 or 1/3. that unit is now straight up trash and will not see play. 

karma change is nice but they will eventually have to give her level up a complete rework. heimer should have his 3 drop swapped for his 4 drop, and even then he probably should get a rework. 

unyielding spirit needed a mana upgrade or a change to fast speed, having it burst speed is absolutely cancer.

vlad change is massive and makes him viable, although he might still need a hp buff or something along those lines. 

stand alone change is fantastic, card is still viable, but can't be used on turn 3 with cancerous 3 drops. still works well with fizz and other 2 drops, and you can still play it on turn 4 but it means you cant block for free on turn 3. 

boomcrew change is nice but i'd prefer it to be a 0/4 rather than a 1/3 from a design pov, but 1/3 is probably better for balance reasons.

monkey idol change suddenly makes that card significantly better and will definitely see play. slotbot change was necessary and now makes that card viable as well.

grizzled ranger is still a powerhouse card in certain decks but isn't an auto include in every demacia deck.

that pilfered goods hasn't been nerfed or changed from drawing from the top of the deck feels really shitty to me, that card has way too much value and is absolute cancer to play against... 

tavernkeeper imo should have been changed to a 2/4 but that might have been OP, freiljord has way too many 3 drops for 3/3 with variety effects.

chevalier change is great as that card is now viable. anything with 1 health going to 2 health and vice versa is an incredible buff/nerf which again just makes me really dissagree with the rearguard nerf... That card fills a needed role of punishing weak early games, now it literally has no role as it is just a shittier version of saboteur",-1
"Since they killed both early-game-focused decks (Burn Aggro/ Demacia Midgro) I'm afraid we'll be having quite some long lasting matches, which I'm really not looking forward to, since my guess would be that we will most likely see greedy mid and control like Ez or Heimer. But thats what one gets if people want to play their wanky decks which get stomped by aggro and they complain long enough instead of adapting to the meta.",-1

"So Noxus is always going to be an aggressive region. One of the regions foundations is fast early aggression. 

What the nerfs to rearguard and boomcrew did was allow for other aggro deck concepts to come back into viability. For instance the Discard Aggro PnZ Noxus deck is still really good into all of the matchups that Burn Aggro is good against, but there was no reason to play it because Burn Aggro was faster so you'd always lose that matchup and it didn't have any advantages over Burn Aggro to compensate. 

Since it looks like Burn aggro is about to fall off due to Legion Rearguard and Boomcrew Rookie being basically necessary 1 and 2 drops in that deck, decks like Discard Aggro or MF Scouts or Iceborn Spiders even might be able to come back into the meta. Which is the reason why Burn Aggro was nerfed in the first place. Not because it was super strong, it wasn't, it just was gating diversity which the devs don't seem to like.",1
"Yeah, I’m not saying Take Heart is good. I’m saying your argument isn’t really valid. Stand alone isn’t strong just because it’s a 3 mana permanent 3/3. It’s the context in which you can use it that makes it so strong.",1
Giving Draven lifesteal would be nice. he's not playable in his stats and it would be nice to see a champion with lifesteal.,1
Something meant to play out across more than 5-6 rounds?,1
Well the problem is that it can’t be countered. The card will still be viable just not a braindead win card against all regions but freljord and ionia,-1
Facts dude. I think deny should be one of those cards.  You can go easy on balancing spell cards if deny was able to be placed on every deck. Hell unyielding spirit wouldn't be a s much as a problem if everyone could have a deny.,-1
The fuck is Mythgard?,-1
Why is the oracle eye not working normally?? Did they change it ?,0
"The problem is that if you could don't attack with Shen at all, you would do that. Every time you attack with Shen you also give your opponent a chance to kill him, and his level up condition is ""see"" which is kind of a bummer. There's actually no point in buffing the attack stat of a defensive unit like him. Yeah, it makes him a little harder to ignore/chump block, but your opponent wouldn't ignore him at first place.",0

"Well you can now block kill rearguard with any 1 drop in the game, vile feast, withering wail, etc. I wouldn't have minded an alternative change to boomcrew rookie, but now there's a lot more that can kill him in a single turn. I think those will be noticeable differences when it gets played out.",-1

Why? So he can die to Legion Rearguard?",-1
"Only took them like 6 months to finally put boomcrew back in its place...

&#x200B;

I don't really get the vlad change, or well I guess I do, it's to give midrange nox a better place. But imo the reason vlad wasn't played isn't because he wasn't good, but only because burn aggro and a faster aggro nox was better (and far too good) than a slower 5 mana champion card could accommodate

&#x200B;

All in all burn aggro got off way too easy in this patch? The boomcrew nerf was much needed and legion rearguard makes 1 attack 1 drops a bit more viable now against burn. But imo the biggest issue was all the straight up face dmg (especially in the form of combat tricks that are designed to deny any healing and trade 1 for 1 (while doing face dmg!) for enemy combat tricks.

Burn aggro is going to see a drop for a week and then it'll be right back like nothing happened imo.

&#x200B;

Edit: good to see stand alone finally get nerfed. it was simply broken if people got lucky enough to draw it on curve. only hope is to save 4 mana and bounce it back , but even then you're getting hit for 6 by zed's clone and are trading 1 card for 1 and losing 1 mana.",-1

"I’m unaware. If it gets buffed, then I’d also probably take issue with it for the same reason. On the instance of damage hat breaks the barrier, no damage is being done.

"Going deep at turn 7 is nowhere need to be nerfed. And going deep at turn 5 needs some luck or tempo lose, which is already bad early for deep decks

"IMO, they don’t need to nerf it—they just need to print more answers to it. 

MTG had Indestructible as a keyword, but the game has so many exile, bounce, counterspell, sacrifice, etc. effects that if you really want to, you can always tech against it. 

In LoR, unless you’re playing Ionia or Demacia (or specifically Sea Monsters w/in Bilgewater), removing an Unyielding champion is literally impossible. There’s no way to stop them from playing the card, and no way to remove the champion once it’s played. Your only hope is to have enough board advantage that you would win anyway in the next couple turns. 

If EVERY region had the option to tech in a recall or capture or obliterate effect, the card would be a lot less toxic.",1

And the fact that it was the only card capable of doing anything to corina control isnt a problem, its the point, its at its strongest against decks that ignore creatures, and at its weakest against decks that rely on them. The card didnt create a warped meta. If anything did, its Corina Control that warped the meta.",-1
"Still top tier, just not god tier. Aggro will always be prevalent.",0
It seems as if your honest thoughts are at odds with the objective facts of the game.,1
I think stolen cards should have reduced cost as they have now but with fleeting. that way players would think twice before stealing and would have to adapt and try to use it on the spot instead of frustrating the enemy any point in future. also this reduces the impact of early game stealing since stealing a very powerful card early on would only be a waste os resources.,-1

By every streamer, LoR content creators and writers, and tournament performances.

Rookie has always been strong but the way it synergised with the new burn cards made it overpowered (such as its interaction with Demolitionist).

3 dmg for 1 mana is pretty neat imo,1
Yeah none of the nerfs will take that deck down at the moment but you'll have to be careful to not get Karma removed since for a deny/Will now you'll need 10 mana(if you play karma you spent 6) but the rest hasn't been touched I think so it should be fine,1
Is the patch coming out today?,0
I like that idea! This seems like a reasonable change that doesn't kill the card and makes everyone happy.,1
I love that deck too. But really it’s just losing power on ranger and badger bear? If you have MF out you’re still pumping out obscene amounts of damage and from experience victories come by going way past 20 nexus damage if you are winning.,-1

"It's a 4th at most and it's receiving heavy nerfs. The hp nerfs are hitting important benchmarks, where boomcrew was near guaranteed an attack and possibly gets 2 before, he will now not even get 1 sometimes. And having better options against rearguard is a huge deal turn 1",1

"Am I reading the same patch note as everyone else? Like I keep seeing ""Midrange is dead"" but like Bannerman never ran Stand Alone anyway so that card getting nerfed into oblivion is irrelevant for that.

And the other 2 cards were two most bullshit, over tuned, never should have printed at their value points anyway cards. I think the only real nerf is that you can't run Vi in Bannerman anymore but that doesn't matter because Garen is a card.

Grizzled Ranger was a double attack 4 attack card that would summon a 4/4 on death for 4 mana in a region with no good 4 drop options. Ranger still gets run in Bannerman I Garentee it.

Badger Bear probably should have gotten printed as 3/4. At this point it's balanced not over powered they didn't nerf it out like they did with Rearguard or Stand Alone. Now it's competing with Protege which is fine.

And like what other Midrange decks even got hit? Deep Meditation is a control card it got it hit. Karma's a control card it got hit. 

Vlad, Shen, Hecarim, Chevalier, Tavernkeeper and Longtooth are all midrange options and they all got buffed.

There must be another link somewhere where Corina got buffed to 2 damage a hit or something because otherwise I don't feel like Bannerman is making an exit.",-1
Except that still doesn't mean it's too strong. That just means either champs are too weak or they're too slow. Once against strength is irrelevant..,1
"First of all, I wanted to say thanks to Riot, these last balance patches are pretty neat! If someone on the team can answer, what's the balance team's view on Braum? Are you guys contemplating a buff? He feels kind of meh, and while Shen and Vlad needed those buffs more than him(thanks BTW) , he is still kind of weak",1
It can seriously brick a hand if the enemy doesn't drop anything major though.,0
"Nope, but you do get a 10%+ chance to get one.",1
"I don't know how you can think that Burn was left unchecked when their strongest 2 drop and arguably their strongest 1 drop got hit with nerfs. Burn really relies on being able to push through early damage, and that's going to be a lot harder to do now.

Also, while the Shen buff didn't really do anything to solve his core problems (that he only really symerguzes well with Demacia), there is a massive difference between 2/5 support unit and a 3/5 support unit. The difference between 2 and 3 is significant in LoR.

I agree that the lack of Freljord changes were disconcerting though. Would have been really nice for Pilfer to pull from the bottom instead of the top. It only really impacts one particular matchup on a balance level, but it also is a lot less tilting to see a card get stolen that you'd never have seen in a match than it is to see them steal one that was about to go in your hand.",0
"Yeah, they're making the patch ""go live"" 24 hours after now to allow mobile clients to get updated before it's live. Otherwise people playing on mobile may have to wait 24 hours to play after a patch since updates go out so sporadically on mobile platforms. They mentioned this in the last patch notes and I believe they mentioned it somewhere again in the current patch notes.",1
Yeah then make the unit unremovable by any means for one round.,0
"The same to changing it. The mechanic itself is balanced, and as I already stated checks adding powerful cards to decks and buff decks. Removing that solely due to feels is equally silly. Not every game should read like a script.

Maybe Shen will be viable again.,0
As it should be,0
"It's not as popular as you'd think, though there are a few of us who run that version.

As for weaknesses. I find that the combat tricks generally aren't enough. It really wants survivability to keep the board intact. Card draw would be nice, but not necessarily needed.

The main weakness of the list is that it snowballs really hard in either direction. You either keep your board in place and roll over your enemy or you lack the ability to keep the board alive pre turn 5 when you want to drop Vlad. If Vlad comes down with only 1 or 2 units on the board you've probably lost.",-1

"The update itself is on Tuesday, the changes are LIVE on Wednesday.",0
I'm glad that card is trash now,1
"Changing the cost and damage output is just destroying the decks win condition. I agree with the direction of the nerfs as nerfing the health of key cards allows for counterplay instead. 3 health cards are easily removed as well as 1 health cards. Your aim isn't to destroy the decks win conditions, it's to give the other decks a chance to counterplay and survive. Nerfing their damage or cost makes the deck too weak to be viable.",1
"Yeah I could see it going that way too, NGL

Still, I think it's telling that one of the highest ranked Bannerman players in NA doesn't even include it.  Especially with stand alone getting nerfed, I don't think it's as oppressive as it seems.  I've won more than my fair share against an invincible minion.  

I'm not a balance expert though, and I'm certainly no expert at LoR, so I defer to the brain trust balancing the game.  But I think we're talking about a card that seems more scary than it turns out being a lot of the time.  I can do a lot with that 8 mana tempo swing it takes to cast unyielding.",1

Classic riot games,-1
I prefer this deck over burn because it aleast takes skill to play the deck. Only burn which plays only 4 cards.,1
"I really hope you are right but i doubt it.

Sure if Karma only was a weak body of 4/3 or 5/4 without any effect you are right. But this is not the case. I don't get your point there. You play normaly Karma in Round 10 and then often it's not necessary to play Unyielding Spirit because you have enough to protect her in these regions. A healing potion for 1 Mana got you 6 Health and so on, so you can take a direct hit easy...and if only Aggro Burn and Bannermen are the Decks which could effectiv beat karma I think it's not really healthy for the meta and as I said (only my opinion) I don't want to build my Deck only to beat Karma and yes there are ways I know but not enough. The meta stretches between Karma/Ez and Aggro/Burn. They nerfed Aggro/Burn enough I think but for a healthy meta they have to do something about Karma. This 1 Mana I think will not change enough.",1
"It's weaker and stronger, depending on context. Contextually I don't like the idea of them chipping through 2 face damage if I set up a chump blocker just because I don't have a 1-damage ping. Outside of Vile Feast *forcing* a 1-damage ping isn't the easiest, and I think a big point about nerfing Burn is to reduce the incentive of going Shadow Isles as its direct answer.

3/1 is definitely weaker, but 3/1 with Overwhelm is not definitely weaker than a 3/2 without Overwhelm. I think I'd prefer the 3/2 in general... but the Overwhelm is still substantial. Especially for a deck that just frontloads face damage and even runs Decimate. Every point matters.",-1
"Since you started talking about aggro decks and how they don't run champions, I assumed you had been matched with a ton of off-meta aggro stuff that didn't run champions. And then I based my responses off that. Obviously you weren't talking about burn aggro, since that was already pretty clearly utterly irrelevant to anything I said. Right?

Turns out you were actually talking about burn, and now that it turns out the entire conversation was null because of your exceptional skill to make utterly irrelevant tangents, somehow i'm simple, whatever that means in this context. What a fantastic discussion.",1

95% of Value playes that will is used for come from it beeing cast during combat or as reaction to a spell. Slow would eradicate all of it, cost does not even matter at this point.",1

Thanks - I think personally if the games wants to keep growing it needs to add a bit more depth. Right now I feel the skill cap is a little too low and lack of draw/mana keeps games a little too predictable too keep serious players interested long term. When I win/lose I want to know it was because I played better/outplayed.,1

Any of my aggro players: where we moving next? Burn and scouts nerfs look decently big and scouts already didn’t seem S tier. I’ve been playing a piltover bilgewater deck in normals and that seems really good (and really successful in master) but it runs boomcrew rookie so idk how that deck will be affected,0
"Honestly, I like the idea of an immortal unit, it spices the game up a bit, and I don't really see how the card is that much of a problem. However, I know the community hates the card, so here is what I want to say: a card like that is hard to nerf/buff because it is one fixated thing. Riot is doing everything they can and have a hard working balance team that tries to make every single card in the game viable. Making it fast or slow doesn't seem like much of a change, but in reality it is and it opens up sooooo much counterplay that can completely deny its value, eventually making the card a meme. You gotta understand that balancing cards in general is hard, and this one is especially hard. So give them time to make the nerf optimal, rather than killing the card completely on wednesday.",-1
or if crimson units recovered 1 health at the end of their turn if there's a Vladimir on the board.,0

">Since when were we talking about specifically burn aggro?

Oh my fucking lord you are so fucking painfully simple.

>The fact that champions are not included doesn't mean the decks themselves are too strong, but rather that the aggro champions are too weak, don't fit enough archetypes or are too slow. The only indicator of how strong an archetype is, is how it actually performs, and currently they're performing badly.

The only aggro deck where champions aren't included is in burn aggro. Anything else from MF Quinn, to Fizz, to Draven Spiders are all fine. They all just fell out of the meta, because aggro burn playrate is so dominant at a whopping 10%. The rest of the meta literally only consists of control counters, or midrange bannermen.

The simple rule is Control > Aggro > Combo > Control. As burn gets nerfed, more combo decks will come out to counter the control dominant meta, which will result in more variant aggro decks arising to beat the combo meta.

Again, Jinx and Draven were fine before the powercreep of 1.0

I guess I shouldnt expect you to suddenly understand simple things after having the same concept explained to you 3 or 4 times.",1
"Oh wow, eager apprentice ! Of course the meta breaking card that will give you an edge in this very spot ! Congrats, you avoided 6 damage at the cost of one card. Spoilers: it's still not worth it.

> More often, they fail to close, get their all-in countered, and lose the game. 

No. More often, they lose simply because they didn't draw their Stand Alone + Zed by turn 3. Otherwise, if the opponent doesn't have Will (or admittedly Thermo), they fall too much behind before being able to answer it.

We don't need games decided by turn 3. Enjoy that deck while you can ! :p",-1
"That's just it. It does work with Crimson Pact. Your entire board takes no damage from Crimson Pact and it still does it's damage. The only thing with the list is that Transfusion is the only health buff that can reliably help.

I'm convinced there's a Bilgewater version that synergizes with Citrus Courier to heal your board after an attack. It would be devastating, I just need to figure out which units need to be in there.",-1
"Can they please have the cards draw from the bottom of the opponents deck instead of from the top. 
Would make it feel a lot better to have the opponent draw a card that you'd realistically never have drawn than to have him draw a card you could have top decked. 
Plus it'd make playing cards like Omen Hawk, Shared Spoils and Starlight Seer vs Bilgewater not feel horrible once they play Pilfered Goods",1

The rookie will still probably hit at least once, and that's basically what you need. Hitting with him twice was kinda overkill already.

"your saying - ""*because it's also ?easier? to deal with than other slow spells.*"" 

Im saying - ""it is not easier to deal with unyielding spirit after successfully playing it, it is **much much harder** to deal with unlike other slow spells"". 

So its equally traded. 

Also stating that it is totally unplayable, is ridiculous. It can still be played, only cards that can stop it completely are cards that require

A) damage to health - which damacia will buff or even shield or tough their unit before even using a 6 mana spell.  They already apply buffs to that unit before using US. 

B) Instant Kill spells - These cards have been a problem either way, making some champions/units useless to even play their effects that happen 2 rounds later. The whole point of Control Cards is for this reason. **To stop threats like US.**

The only exceptional card is will of ionia, which hurts other decks that contain buffing unit strat massively either way. 

Also Decks that have US, have other ways of winning besides using US. 


IF ppl want US to be immune, then make champions immune as well.

**Because Instant Kill spells are annoying to every card. US should join the club....**",-1
"What would you think of just dropping the Plunder clause on Pilfered Goods? A two cost steal one at burst is still really good, but not so abhorrent.

IMO he would be much better as 4 mana 4/5 or 4/4 with regen, secondly make his ability do damage to enemies not nexus as 4-5 damage to nexus in late gaming is nothing unless both players have strong wide boards which is not probable as vlad hits every ally every attack, I had some games like that but Vlad usually was ""win more character"". He just feels bad to play and probably the worst hero in the game. Literally every character is a big threat if he is unanswered, look at all other 5 mana champions. Garen, if you let him lvl up you basically lose the game if enemy has good board. Karma, no comment. Vi, no comment. Thresh has actual strong ability which swings the game heavily if he attacks at lvl up, not pathetic 2-3 dmg into nexus. Heimer will spam entire board with turrets if left for one-two turns. Gankplank, not that strong but he is crazy dangerous at lvl up, 1-2 damage into nexus AND every enemy on the board AND bonus damage from overwhelm. And Swain which has easy lvl up requirement, hard to kill, fearsome and will swing the game if coupled with Leviathan. All these champions provide much greater value for same mana, it is sad that he is designed to be the champion of crimson/sacrifice decks but actually feels more like strong follower. Simply occupies valuable hero spots but doesnt do anything special, simply not worth it.",1

"Just because Vladimir now heals the Nexus doesn't suddenly make the Champion playable. The archetype's problem was never a lack of survivability.

Then he tears apart the board, thus giving you a disadvantaged attack. If you don't win on the turn Vladimir attacks, you usually lose the game the next turn.

"when a card is tossed or stolen by the enemy, its no longer in your deck and you cant play it, so they're both similar in that way. since toss reveals what is removed from deck, so should pilfer. Most of the negative feeling around pilfer right now is that the cards drawn are unpredictable and that you could be playing a deck reliant on cards no longer in your deck after being stolen. if the cards stolen are revealed, the helps fix both of those concerns, allowing counter-play to the stolen cards and allowing the player that had cards stolen to avoid playing toward a strategy with a missing finisher",-1

"It's a contextual nerf/buff.

Nerf: less effective versus Freljord, especially buffs on top-of-deck and Avarosan Trapper etc. that adds Yetis to the top of their deck.

Buff: means theft mechanics do not accelerate the chances of your opponent drawing into Champions, which is mostly a buff in my opinion, but it's more situational than that.

"No, it doesn't.

Its a tier 1 deck which completely surpressed the meta into being burn aggro/burn aggro counters. Its why Corina Spiders almost immediately climbed in popularity after burn aggro dominated the meta.

I have no idea why you're arguing that fact. Riot already stated that burn aggro had highly disproportionate winrates, and has already nerfed the deck.

Burn aggro has existed since beta, and it was a pretty balanced t2 deck. It ran Draven, and sometimes ran the Jinx discard variant. The introduction of demolitionist and fervor powercreeped the deck to be the monster it is.

The solution isn't to further powercreep champions so they're strong enough to be in the strongest deck in the game. That's stupid. Nerfing Boomcrew and Rearguard is fine. From Riot's own statement, Itll likely be that more and more burn spells will be nerfed until Draven is included again.",1

"What I did is I threw in a few 1 mana, gives +1/0 and quick attack in my deck. It's a burst spell, so the only way that your hec will die on his first attack is if they have a 5 dmg burst removal or the opponent has 7+hp, in which case you should be making other plays and not attacking.",-1
"Depends. Many decks can kill, say, an unbuffed Fiora easily, but not a Garen. Of course, you can just wait until the opponent doesn’t have enough mana up or you have a Riposte.",0
"Yeah imo the card turned from A+ tier into F tier. the card will never be used anymore. If riot is really unhappy with the fact that its 3 damage drop on turn 1 if your opponent cant block, I reckon they could rework it by raising the cost to 2 and change the stats to reflect it. 

But nerfing Boomcrew rookie is already a huge nerf to burn. Idk how to feel about this...",-1
"thing is, burn as a deck was a problem, not the burn cards. so when you nerf the burn spells, it effects many decks which aren't a problem (noxian fervor nerf hits swain decks really hard, which are weak anyway). by nerfing reargueard they destroyed the card itself maybe, but weakened burn enough so it isn't oppressive hopefully but didn't nerf the other noxus archetypes.

i think the nerf was a very clever one actually.",-1
"So a turn 1 Rearguard was a little annoying like a Fervent Champion in MtG mono red (""they always have it""), but it was obviously not a crucial card. The reach package that lets them sit and not attack just waiting for good draws is the real problem. I would really like to see Grenadier and Demolitionist go down to 1 damage.

"Burn's getting hit hard with the changes to Rearguard and Boom Crew. Now RG can die to any one-drop, or as you suggested thermo, and it can no longer be a a target for Imperial Demolitionist.

"I hope so! I've played around with those fellas in the past, and the results have been fun but not powerful.

I still think it'll be a fairly memey list, but one can dream.",1
Yeah a 1 drop 4/1 totally makes sense. If you only play THAT ONE deck.,1
"Boomcrew nerf feels very justified. At 4 health it let you do lots of dumb things in burn aggro.

Rearguard nerf though makes the card unplayable. If you could block with it I think it would be fine, but the insane amount of 1 dmg pings out there make it useless.",-1
"Dont know why this is getting downvoted when youre absolutely right

Must be scum that enjoy having overpowered abilities and burst cards that cant be stopped",1

Rearguard gave burn aggro too much flexibility with transfusion and black powder girl,1
Ah I guess i didnt pay close enough attention :P. Thanks!,1
"In my opinion:

Vlad change seems really strong but I never used his deck before so can't rate the change.

Karma nerf won't really change much, 1 mana will be felt but I think she needs a rework not nerfs, her levelled up form is the real problem here.

Shen buff is really nice but he will still be really niche and I think he needs more supporting cards.

Vi nerf is much needed but I'd prefer her losing tough and gaining more health, she will still be used a lot I feel.

Hecarim buff is not going to make a huge difference, just a placebo buff imo.

Badgerbear/Grizzled Ranger nerf thank god these two cards were batshit insane. Grizzled Ranger was the best card in the game imo and now it's much more reasonable yet still strong.

Laurent Challenger's buff only matters if you're pulling 1 attack units or you buff him so imo the card still sucks but not garbage suck just suck suck.

Stand Alone is now a dead card sine you can only really use it on a 2 drop before it becomes a brick most of the time, the card needs a rework and I believe this is more of a band-aid nerf.

Kindly Tavernkeeper is a good card now after this buff, nice change.

Boomcrew Rookie's well deserved nerf, will make aggro much less consistent since you have less chance to swing for 4 burn damage since boomcrew could attack twice with his hp.

Legion Rearguard nerf is nonsense, I don't think it needs any nerfs at all. Card will straight up be unplayable now.

Slotbot might be broken with this change? have to see it in effect but looking at it right now it seems busted lol

Monkey Idol seems really good now, will see play imo.

Chum the waters might be a decent card to run as a slower form of removal with the Longtoth buff and it buffs Fizz too so thats nice because he was pretty weak.

Deep meditation nerf is really harsh holy FUCK did that card get gutted super hard, it's still draw power that Ionia lacks so it will still be used, maybe just a 1 or 2 of instead of auto 3 in every deck. Bit overboard imo (eye of the dragon should have gotten hit with a smaller nerf on this card imo).

Brood awakening reverted into an unplayable card, yeah it was too op at 5 mana but no one's going to run it anymore with the amount of 1 damage board pings in the game. Should have gotten a mechanic change instead imo

Edit: i forgot the 5/5 scout, that card wil be played in scout decks imo looks like a good change
That wraps up my thoughts :) Overall good balance patch

Top decks are all hit, expecting Lux/Karma and Corina Control to still be tier 1 decks, with Nautilus and TF decks (slotbot looks busted) might be joining their spots.

Hopefully next month we see unyielding spirt rework and more freljord buffs",1
I would assume that that would def end up in the bug section so probably not. Hopefully I'm wrong.,0
"Riot is clueless in terms of CCG design. They refuse to learn anything from other games and insist on reinventing the wheel every patch and expansion. 

They want MTG starting health, but with Hearthstone  / TES Legends power level followers. They want gene ending Champion and even Fillower effects...but refuse to print answers / removal that are even close to efficient. 

Their game design tries to force Hearthstone levels of board battling...then they print Karma, and Burn, and completely invalidate interaction anyway.

Design is a mess. Balance is a disaster. And I'm not real sure they CAN fix it.",-1
"Drawing from your opponent's deck helps them get to their champions, because you can't draw their champions. If you drew from the bottom of their deck, there would be no drawback whatsoever.",1
True but being 6 means you can't save 3 Mana turn 9 and on 10 drop karma and ez and still have 5 mana left over to otk from 20 hp with 1 cost spells. So it's something at least.,0
"What the hell Rito the emote meta is in shambles! How will it possibly adjust to the introduction of rainbow poro, top-deck teemo and sweating ezreal!?",-1
"I just don't get what they are thinking...

They completly murdered Lux-Karma, Fiora-Zed Stand Alone (just... why? it wasn't even a competitive deck) and hit pretty hard Corina Control as well.

Meanwhile they barely touched burn, bannermen is laughing since they basically lost nothing (before someone point out the BW duo,  i'd like to remind that bannerman was a tier 1 deck before BW as well) since Grizzled will still be auto-include (the -1 attack doesn't change anything, most of the times it's still a 2-for-1) and at worst the bear will be replaced by Zed (if they splash Ionia) or Fiora/Laurent Protege for more control and Deep will also rise the ranks guaranteed.

Unyelding Spirit somehow didn't got nerfed, and the idiotic steal mechanic wasn't even touched at all.

Overall i'm very disappointed by this patch, 100% sure midrange (either bannermen or deep, take your pick) will dominate this month meta. I guess now people will be happy tho.

The only exciting thing in this patch note is the announcement on the 29th, which hopefully means the announcement of a new game mode (we desperately need it, i hope it's something very similar to tavern brawl from hearthstone).",-1
I totally nailed the nerf in Grizzled Badgerbear and Loyal Badgerbear. Also a lot of cards that were nerfed and even buffed. :),1
"Yeah, legion saboteur is superior in every single way now, except that when she gets blocked she only does 2 instead of rearguards 3 dmg.

Otherwise she can deal 3 to enemy nexus like rearguard, or have 1 guaranteed dmg to nexus, she can block and rearguard is just so weak atm",-1

"Unless it's a demacian Fiora deck Shen is still really underwhelming.

I'm still struggling to find other followers and heroes that are worth using barrier on but investing 4 Mana on Shen is already a burden, getting a second champion on the field is hard with all the card removal. 

Barrier assist only happens on attack, if Shen attacks. The power buff helped him fight better but he isn't a threat and us more of a hassle that takes too much setup and investment for pitiful rewards. 

My suggestion:

Remove ""support"" and just let Shen apply a barrier when in battle to himself,.or another Ally on the field. This creates a lot of powerful diverse protection at the risk of him going into battle but remaining a tank. 

When leveled up, give Shen challenger. Similar to a tank braum, this change will let Shen actually support his Ally and open up enemies to attack. Very thematically matching as well as his taunt in the og game is fitting",-1

"It also gives less mana to use in the turn you play her, before (if you had 3 spell mana) you could play her on T10 and give her unyielding spirit now you can't, the nerf isn't directed at the turn it can be played but to how many spells and which ones you can play if she is dropped leveled",1
"Deep is really interesting imo.  


Vulnerably to mushrooms, can be milled if outplayed, can be vulnerable to pilfer (depends on how both players handle it, but it makes for very interesting interactions and tense back and forth with the mill becoming the meta game during the match while nexus hp is also still in play)

I feel like with almost any deck I have a fair chance against it (ditto against any deck playing at it) and it'll depend mostly on decisions made.

There's also so many ways to play it: Deep rush midrange, mill, healing/control, OTK with fearsome buffing 8 cost (forgot the name),  Rushing treasures.

That's all good design imo, it keeps you guessing what the enemy's strategy is and makes every game play out different.

"Maybe this change will push it in a more traditional aggro direction rather than full burn. 

The only reason people played almost exclusively direct damage is because it worked, but maybe there is a way to build it by cutting some of the worst direct damage cards and trying to keep the board for a couple turn to land more minion damage (sometimes with the help of the overwhelm spell).

Since Demacia & spiders got hit hard too there might be some room for a burny aggro deck (rather than a pure burn deck)",-1

"Well there are matchups in this game, you can't expect your deck to be on an even playing field with everything. My main deck deals with burn pretty well, but struggles in some other matchups. I think burn's popularity will get toned down by this, but if one specific build is too much of an issue for you, you should build something that does better at countering it. And these nerfs will probably make that easier for you.",1
"The thing about Lucian bannerman is that bannerman has like 10 different flavors (Lucian/Zed/rally, Vi, mono-Demacia with Fiora/Garen, splash maybe a couple of denies, splash Miss Fortune, Bannerman scouts, etc.), so Lucian/Zed not seeing as much play is just because they fall under the same big umbrella of ""bannerman"". 

The deck is sort of decent, but the problem is that it's the ""smaller bannerman"" list, so it has a very hard time against the bigger bannerman lists, while burn is just fast enough to beat it.",-1

What leads you to believe it needs a nerf?,0
"Really love the Hecarim and Shen buffs. I think it’s good that unyielding spirit is being looked at,  as pairing it with Dusk to Dawn is pretty broken. Even being ephemeral, they don’t die at the end of the round because of US. Pair this combo with death mark cards, you basically can farm ephemeral marks and just place ‘em on enemies for 3 mana each. Not that mana means anything anymore, because you permanently have 3 allies. Purify is viable if you US a follower, but as of now their are no counters to a US champ card (If I’m not mistaken, recall will not get rid of US.) 

I still think Maokai needs to be looked at, maybe have his level up numbers bumped up to 30. Of course you could always beat it by early rushing, but unless you get a perfect draw or mulligan the odds of winning before the opponent goes deep are pretty low. I saw a suggestion on another forum to adjust some of the Toss cards to be on round start or when another ally dies. Also remove Tough from Naut. He’s already 13-13, plus with the other sea monsters the opponent has, we’ve got bigger fish to fry. 

For the Piltover-Zaun Vi nerf, I think it’s pretty good. It lowers her value as a filler card, but for a dedicated deck she’s still (Vi)able (XD). The boom crew rookie nerf is also pretty welcome, as using it to get multiple procs of imperial demolitionist will be more costly. 

I think this patch is a great start for LoR. Nothing got nerfed into oblivion, and many decks that were a bit too easy to pull off are now in a much better place in terms of learning/skill curve. Kudos to Riot.",1
"*Carefully Removes the dust and cockroaches from my Vladimir deck*

Ahh... You are... Alive finally... I knew this day would come...",1
Lol,1
"These days I'm playing Freljord and I wasn't that disappointed with the changes, I see my most troublesome cards are nerfed, my removals and trades are more efficient, my tavern keeper have better stats, I can cut one and add something heavy like a 6 drop; hearthstone teach us how you have to be careful with class that have ramp and huge stats -and freeze- because if they become too good during the early game they become unstoppable. Also they're showing an attitude for big balance patches that can mean that if Frej needs another buff they will most certainly deliver.",1
"Yeah playing for the money, there are streamers who just got their viewers by flaming the balance team, best on the market u won't call that a thing till there is a game similar  only 2 succesful moba right now are LoL and  dota 2 and Dota2 is so different in terms of gameplay plz don't embarrass ur self anymore told u to stop talking about things u know nothing about.",1
Would making the shadows from hecarim spawn to the left be too strong? Having hecarim die on level 2 with a threatening lethal feels really bad. If they threatened to hit first before hecarim trades and force removal or harder blocks on the shadows.,-1

The Ezreal Sweating one is inspired.  Love it.,1
you saying the bannerman nerf did nothing to its power shows you dont play bannerman. the 1 power of him was a irrelevant part of the nerf the fact that he now only has 3 health is huge and makes his floor so much lower. a 4 mana 4/4 is a decent card a 4 mana 3/3 is hot trash.,0
It's not currently as egregious as some of the other violators on the list but a bump to 5 mana wouldn't be out of line.,0
"Nobody:

Not a single soul:

Litterally no one :

Not even god:

You : ""net naut""",-1
"I'm not saying it would have to be exactly Path to Exile, obviously it wouldn't cost just 1 mana.",0
"Yeah, that's polarising gameplay. Have a block/answer or don't. If you don't, then he just Decimated your face for 1 Mana and still has a 4/1 Can't Block threat.

That doesn't sound reasonable at all.

It definitely can't be a 4/1. The only collectable 4-Attack 1-Drop in the game right now has Ephemeral, and rightfully so.",1
"Burn agro is going from S tier to B tier at best. Both rearguard and boom crew are unplayable now, and it’s gonna be hard to find solid replacements for them",1
I think the fact that Make it Rain can flip Ezreal insanely quickly makes it a strong contender. For sure some form of Ezreal is going to be prominent in the meta now that burn won't be played as much.,1
"Similar to Riot's watchlist entry, this is not a comment on his power level, but his decks tilt so far toward reactive that it's just miserable to play against, win or lose.",0
That 1 power on Shen lol,1
"SLOTBOT BUFF
THANKS RITO",1
"Ok, I see the actual patch note now. Sorry I couldn't find the LEAKED one.",1
"Yeah, which is why he's great when you get him off rememberance. He rarely finds a suitable board state at turn 5 for that, and there is far too much competition at his Mana slot to make it in anyway. But getting him turn 3 off of rememberance feels really good",1
More then jinx/drav is a RIP every single nox/p&z aggro decks that arent burn,0
"People who are convincing themselves that Bannermen is dead have either forgotten or didn't know that Bannermen was THE tier 1 deck several weeks before Rising Tides.

At the very least, the deck will still be tier 2.",-1
Monkey?,0
I haven't heard this take before but I kind of really like it. I think it should probably drop to 6 or 7 mana and grant barrier immediately as well but otherwise think it would be a great change. It still provides substantial value every turn but doesn't just hard stop interaction if you're the wrong faction.,1
"Agree to disagree. In Hearthstone if you were decent at Arena, it wasn't that hard to go infinite and have easy access to all the cards. Maybe before the Expeditions nerf I would've agreed with you.",1
"We don't need more rally effects in the game..
Specially not in demacia",0
"I wanted to be whiney about mf/quinn, but I think a big problem was the bear scout man guy. Since he's nerfed, it'll be a bit easier. But this is from a newb (less than 3 weeks) playing deep bois",0
Yeah thinking about it more 1 hp on a 1 drop basically only makes it good if your opponent doesn't have a turn 1 play. And even then it basically makes it a 1 mana deal 3 damage to your opponent which is ok. Maybe you start getting tricky with it by sending it off with Noxian Fervor or transfusion to get some value out of it but the more I think about it the more I think you're right and the 1 HP makes the card almost unplayable.,0
"Theses nerfs though.  

&#x200B;

Baby i love it",1
"I also expected some change to deep, not because it is broken, but because the value is extreme.",0
"How is 5 mana slow spell for a 6/3 in 3 units body op ?

Now that it's 6 mana it's worthless with so many better 6 drops",0
"If you compare it to the Saboteur it feels like he got the shorter end of the stick. Now they both have 1 health and do 3 damage unblocked. Saboteur however does 1 damage even blocked and can block herself if she needs to.

Yes Rearguard kills 3 health blockers, but that is almost an edge case.
Agreed however that it is not an interesting card.",-1
"I think the answer is there's just a lack of removal options in the game right now, particularly ones that can deal with it. If this were MTG, is Unyielding Spirit that good? Not really, you just exile it. But there's like...Detain, Will, a couple Obliterates, and...what else that can bounce/obliterate a card?",1
"Yeah, yeah, Grizzled was absolutely bonkers, I don't have any complaint about that, totally deserved nerf. And for badger, as I said, I understand the he was also a ""bit"" too strong, I just got this feeling that the card lost a little bit of it's ""flavour"". That being said, 3/4 is still a great body, so, I may be wrong about this.",1
"Hapless,Cithria and Dreg Dredgers would like a word",1
What deck is that favored?,1
"What? I make my own decks that has a variety of cards in it.  I dont follow the ""meta"" a ""theme"" or ""net deck"".  Nor do I build around a certain card unless its obvious I need to like the frost bite (or whatever its called) stuff.  But for him, you dont need to build around it.",1
"Double the cost and 4x the attack previously...along with scout etc.

The two really aren't comparable. Ranger is a threat without being killed.",-1
"That's besides the point. Obviously you're going to run good cards like Unyielding Spirit, because you WANT to win.

Playing Pilfered Goods is crazy because you literally don't know what you're going to draw into and you're literally betting on the heart of the cards (not to mention 2 mana draw 2 is kind of nuts. Did they not just nerf the Ionia 2 mana draw 2?).

Like you could get a useless Loyal Badgerbear, or you could steal the Will of Ionia you need to win, but only if they have a Will in deck, and you just have to bank on a chance.",1
"Game has weird mechanics anyway. A Lifesteal unit can ""drain"" 5+ life from a Spiderling, too.",0
"Yeah, after waiting a month to see changes I was hoping to see wider changes. Plus having to wait another month for the next set of balance changes (if I'm reading the cadence changes right)   


The watchlist especially calling out all the cards / combos I consistently see argued about on here...feels bad. Like they recognize they're problematic (even if they aren't overpowered) but don't have any plans to touch them.",0
"His effect should be

Plunder: double the ammount of your powder kegs

Nexus strike : adds 2 powder kegs and steal 1 of your opponent's card in their hand",0
"As someone who plays a deck centered around Vladimir and Shen

I am in love with this",1
"6 would still be too good and the card needs some kind of counter play. Cost 6 would allow you to use it on turn 3-4 on a targets such as Zed/Fiora/Elise/Lucian/Teemo/Etc. if you forced your opponent to use his resources to kill it before it happened. 9 cost would also help (but not enough) and cost 10 would kill the card altogether (Like Warmother's Call, which is still powerful but also quite powerful and slow so pretty much no one plays it). 

If you're playing Demacia with Ionia (as an example) you'll need a total of 12 mana to play it with a deny, which can be achieved at turn 9 and that's not that crazy if you ask me for the power that card gives you and if they deny it means you forced your opponent to waste a resource on it, which allows you to use your remaining mana for other things too. 

Another take (which is something I've writing a lot lately) is to limit the effects of Unyielding Spirit during combat... which would limit the card but would make ""more sense"".",0
You have the same cards and there is only one current version of the card.,0

"I heavily disagree there. I think that the support units need to be 2/3s or 3/2s. For instance, look at herald of spring, and how it's utterly unplayable. War chefs is good for a single attack, and then the next time, it's probably dead outside a bannerman buff.",-1

This is like the first rendition that I used early on in the ladder. It’s got a lot of versatility with opportunities with Twin Shadows on Hec Zed or Greenglade duo.

"It's more haphazard design from a team that has no idea what kind of game it wants to make. I mean, let's keep good removal to a minimum to encourage interactive board trades. Then also make Larma and Heimer and Ledros and Burn archetypes. 

Riot needs to have a serious sit down and pick a coherent design philosophy. Stop trying to literally combine Hearthstone with MTG and make their own game.

Ezreal decks shouldn't kill your units, they should be afraid of potion of iron. I usually like the Ezreal matchup.

Totally agree.  Buffing Hecarim does nothing when ephemeral is garbage.,1
"Is a 3 mana draw 2 spells, which is different since ionia wants to draw spells. In digital card games 3 mana draw 2 is standard, but in LoR where you have a maximum of 3 spell mana every turn from turn 3 is a great deal, the problem with the card was the 4 mana cost with no condition, i've played it many times just for triggering the eye of the dragon or the other deep medition in the next turn. 5 mana is too much now for that usage",1

People are just complaining because the deck had a high play rate while people climbed for the beginning of the season.

Aggro is already
1) a coin toss
2) easy to counter
3) loses or trades evenly with Demacia
4) loses to most control decks unless they draw perfect
5) insanely weak against any type of healing

Boomcrew was justified. Rearguard wasn’t.",0

I think it would be cool if Vlad took Nexus health to buff all other units instead like a mass Transfusion. I imagine taking like 1 point of health per other unit to give them each +1/+1 then maybe returning that health after the round per other unit that actually survives combat.,1

"Karma being increased in mana makes situations like playing her + several spells i.e. two Wills, Unyielding Spirit, etc. no longer a possibility in the same turn, and in general is a huge tempo loss in late-game situations where you may have forced answers from your hand in a previous turn and don't have banked spell mana.

Additionally, the nerfs to Grizzled Ranger/Badger Bear, Deep Meditation, etc. really hurts their mid-game - it's a pretty unbeatable comp late game, and so they relied on these huge sturdy units in the mid-game to survive until then, so now it might be easier to beat Karma/Lux decks down before they go off post-10.

"Frejlord actually got an enormous buff.

Sej mid-range/control decks were strong, but got shit on by burn. Now they have much more game against burn (omen hawk kills most burn 1-drops) AND Sej kills Vi.

"VI is in a weird spot.   
She's great when you draw her early and have cards to play but if you play against Ionia you get countered so hard.

If you top deck her in late game she's useless.",-1
"Karma could be played on round 5-6 before, for some decks that didn't built around doublecast shenanigans. Not top decks, but it was still viable. (My deck, specifically, so I'm a bit salty.).

On Vi....I have to ask, what decks exactly 'synergize with her kit'? I'm not aware of any. This is sounding an awful lot like the mentality behind Hecarim's first nerf - you want to make him viable in decks that 'synergize with his kit' eh? You mean ephemerals? Yeah cool...but ephemeral decks aren't a thing. So you're improving the champion's performance in a deck that doesn't exist?

Right.",1
I think it does become unplayable at fast speed and I hate the card.,-1
How should I feel?,0
"Listen, I'm just saying I've seen Ezreal shipped with almost every girl and guy in League's mythos that is remotely human (and a couple that, frankly, *aren't*).  So really, take your pick.",0
">Unyielding Spirit has been among the more contentious cards in Rising Tides due to its powerful Burst speed effect and ability to circumvent opponents’ interaction.

If the problem is the Burst speed, just change that.",0
"Update to people who saw that I played a Shen/Vlad deck

Hooooly hell does this deck feel so much better to play. 

Shen is threatening with the extra damage and is tanky enough to handle early Fearsome units (esp with barriers in hand)

The drain from Vlad can allow for SUCH a huge swing, especially when attacking with a few Crimson Disciples or Curators.

It also feels a lot easier to get Vlad to Level 6, which may be because Aggro has fallen out of the meta which makes discples, curators and even grovetenders harder to kill.

Overall, play Vlad/Shen. It’s VERY good.",-1
"It should(and will, one month from now) be 3/1, overwhelm, can't block.",0
I'm definitely excited by the number of buffs! Feels like a lot of CCGs only ever nerf things down instead of helping out struggling decks.,1
the poro emote is free?,1
"Yes they will be released with the patch. 

The Teemo one looks amazing lmao.",1
The only thing that can kill it on Turn 2 was a Culling Strike. But despite that fact that’s one card out of thousands that makes Boomcrew so strong.,0
No tournament/Esport/Competitive scene update? \*sadness\*,0
I’ve seen the video and don’t agree with everything swim says. Sorry.,0
"Deep does really well against Lux/Karma btw. Amazingly so actually but it's not obvious tho so I see why you might have overlooked it. Deep should theoretically keep rising after this patch as they were untouched. New archetypes might develop too, so the meta isn't totally predictable atm so you can't just assume that it will just be championless burn falling out of favor while everything else will stay exactly the same. Who knows, maybe a good Vlad or hecarmin deck emerges due to combination of their slight buffs and some nerfs of other decks. Swain decks could keep rising and also give karma/lux some fits.


Grizzled Ranger, loyal badger bear, karma, and deep meditation got a nerf. Nothing too severe but it's also not nothing which you think it is. Even with the slight rememberance buff, I do not think this deck would be the best deck in the game anymore which could be argued it was pre patch. It's safe to say that it will naturally go down atleast a nudge or 2, and saying otherwise, you even said it was ""incredible"" for it, is a little puzzling so it's why people disagreed with you fyi.",1
Just make it cost 10 mana and it's ok as it is,0
i finished a lux/karma deck today (i got the third lux). it's still viable with this changes? (i'm a f2p player and just started a month ago).,0
"Pet? The 2/1 spider? But compare Rearguard to Cithria and Butcher now as they all have 4 points of stat and it's pretty sad that he has a ""can't block"" tag for it while the other two only has more positive traits.

I agree it would be good to make some of the spells unit only for sure.",1
"Fair fair I’m def biased by playing a lot of burn this last patch, but in plat I was losing a lot of games by one point of health or barely winning by one point of health, and the early damage from rearguard and the safe (removing a 4 health minion seems almost impossible for most decks) damage of boomcrew felt super necessary. To be fair in burns’ good matchups it might not matter too much, some decks definitely get ran over with an ok/good draw.

It’ll probs still be decent but imo just not S tier like this last patch",1
"*Heavily* depends on matchup, if you're ahead against a region with direct damage it's fine.",-1
"That's a pretty nice buff actually, not sure why you don't count that as an Ephemeral deck buff.",1
And that ezreal emote.,0
"That's actually a great idea! Doesn't nerf the card per-se, but it just makes it less frustrating to play against. I second this!",1
"it actually got indirectly got buffed, without burn it might actually be a viable deck now",0
Thank you to all the people suggesting that vlad should have drain. He will now retain meme tier and not get buffed for awhile cause y’all suggested a terrible buff. I can’t think of when drain would do anything for a vlad deck gg ffs,-1
"Awesome, thanks. The ones I’ve played against are way more SI-focused so I’ll give your Ionia one a go. Thanks",1
"Real talk: the Dreg Dredgers have become one of my favorite followers in the game. Not because of what they do, since I can't stand playing Deep/sea monster decks, just because they're *so goddamn funny.* They're like Runeterra's version of those minion things from Despicable Me.",0
"Bannerman buff, barriers, cithria attack, rangers resolve, radiant strike

There are lots of options for Demacia",0
"Rearguard is very hard to balance. As a 3/2 its too strong, as a 3/1 its gonna be too weak. Maybe make it a 4/1 so it punishes if not blocked but also dies to anything?",0
I did play with them but it’s ok ! Thanks for your answer,1
"You clearly have some rose tinted glasses. There was absolutely no way you could get all the cards fast in hearthstone without paying. Even going infinite in Arena took a long time, you needed to also not just be good but really damn good to turn infinite into an actual good profit. Otherwise its just a pack every few hours, then you need like 20 of those per legendary. You can go infinite way easier in LoR anyway, ignoring all the other great rewards.

If you look at things objectively its just not even close the speed you get cards. I played this game for 5 weeks in beta and had almost every card, they even made it faster now in full release.",1
"Read the top of the page. ""The patch will still be on tuesday but you won't see the effects until 24 hours later.""",0
"So, give it more health? More damage?",-1
"that one more health means that they will often not live to another turn when they previously would have and are now dying to a lot more stuff. Having 4 health instead of 3 makes a huge difference e.g. so many spells deal 3 damage even your own noxus deal 3 to your own unit to deal 3 dmg .  That 1 hp nerf on the 3/2 also means that the unit now dies to a lot of 1/1 drops or vile, or that other aoe spell that heals and it cannot be a free target for  Imperial Demolitionist anymore so Imperial Demolitionist indirectly got nerfed for that deck too due to having one less target . Which is another 2 damage that cannot get through for atleast 1 turn or sacrificing a unit which again is 2-3 damage.

Those 2 cards having 1less health will mean that you won't get out 2-7 damage in a lot of games in while you previously would have gotten up to 5 dmg out and with that burn aggro deck running out of steam at the end of the game every damage points matters and these 1hp nerfs are huge for the winrate.",-1
"Thanks, didn't know about that.",1
"My version runs 2 Vanguard Sargeant as a body but also for the For Demacia! spell. It helps when you don't have a Cithria to drop on 6. The closest thing we have now is Ranger's Resolve, which is good, but not enough sometimes.",1
"Actually the facts are that burn was way too powerful and had way too large of the share of the ladder. If you ran into burn and was not playing shadow isle you were fucked.  Demacia midrange was a little strong but Demacia got nerfs. Bannerman got hit , badgerbear, ranger, stand alone all got nerfed. And lux/karma got hit too. We can agree to disagree but I think you have a slight biases against control. I'm probably  a little biased against aggro cause my favorite decks fall short cause they don't run isle lol",-1
Spot on mate!,0
They’re saying if they change the speed or mana cost it’s just making it towards unplayable and not more towards balances so then need to think of how they might actually rework it.,0
He keeps losing to toss decks because he doesn't know how to adapt to different enemy playstyles and now wants the mechanic deleted.,-1
That is probably better than to be an autoinclude in every SI deck.,1
But they're extremely slow,0
Bears nerf is nothing in demacia scout decks. Attack buff attack again.,-1
"Same here on a pixel 2, very annoying",-1
"It still takes some times to build up a collection, it hasn't been a month that you've started, of course you aren't getting everything super fast, but it's still the most generous CCG out there. In a month, out of the new champions the only one that I'm still missing is one copy of Quinn, and I could craft it.",1
they only do balance patches once a month so its kinda easy to predict,1
"I believe that oppressive late game cards are a healthier way to keep Karma in check then aggressive cards. 
While the former let you and your opponent to go through the strategies built in the decks and win through most of the cards, the latter simply denies any strategy and play and if it cannot then it simply fails but still doesn't let you play the game as its full existence because it burns out too fast. (no pun intended) 

Also, Karma got nerfed and I think it is bigger than it seems",0
"It has potential, but yeah, there are a lot of ways every aspect of the deck can be dealt with. It's weak to Ionia but one of the most interesting midrange decks I've played and I love how much synergy there is across the board.",1
So when are you gonna start calling for cursed keep nerfs?,0
that really depends on what deck you are playing Which I think is the point.,0
"My problem with the burn aggro is unless I have the right cards, it’s over by round 5 or 6. I’ve been dealt over 30 damage multiple times by then and been healing and playing troops as often as I can. I’m glad they’re nerfing it but it’s a whole army of their cards that are the problem, not just one or two. I think they need to nerf the direct damage. Boom crew only doing 1 each attack, etc. way too reliable of damage.",-1
"Agreed. With Freljord being the region with the most synergy with Vladimir, it needs a few more survivability buffs to really push the self harm archetype into viability. Ember Maiden and Stormclaw Ursine were neat additions to certain variations on the archetype, but ultimately weren't enough. Definitely needs more Freljord buffs.",0
How did the stats even get that high? Doesn't it only raise based on the numbers of cards drawn in the previous turn? Did he stack a bunch of buffs on it or something?,0
"I think that nerfs its survival/Vlad archetype way too much. Being able to withstand enemy pressure is a massive deal for Crimson Disciple, and it applying half as much pressure all by itself is also extremely weakening. You're basically forcing Disciple to be used as a Transfusion battery and pretty much as a Burn card as well, since I don't think any Survival deck wants to run a 2 Mana 1/3 that is specialised in blocking teeny tiny attacks and being used as fodder. As a 2/3 even with half its effect it has versatility.",-1
Yup vlad is more dead. Instead of getting an actual buff it’s a near useless change as rarely is he on the Backfoot and if he is he has no minions to drain with. Community was stupid for pushing this. Sure it fits his theme but does absolutely nothing to help noxus not increase synergy with cards. Fml my favorite card still trash. Who knows when he’ll get attention again,-1
"Looking forward to Slotbot meta, should be fun!",1
When you play trapper and opponent stole your yetti. Easiest surrender.,1
"Rearguard was the target of the nerf because it was the best way to take burn down without hitting other noxus decks. 

Karma, I agree with, although I'm not convinced that she needs a rework just yet, but Heimer is completely fine.

Unyielding spirit is on the watchlist, the decks it's in are already receiving hefty nerfs.

Vlad likely still isn't meta after this change, considering how far outside of it he was in the first place. 

stand alone just became unviable, although it was impossible to stop it from being cancer without taking it out of viability, I fell like they could have at least tried out taking it down to +2/+2. They might have tried this eternally and felt it was still bad design, however.

Flavor wise i would prefer 0/4 on boomcrew, but it needed to go down to 3 hp for game balances sake.

still not convinced on eithers viability, they both feel a bit slow, but could be very fun cards in certain decks.

I'm not sure what decks wouldn't use grizzled ranger now, the 4 mana demacia slot is a bit empty, and chevalier still feels like it would not make the cut in any deck over ranger, or along side it. 

pilfered goods is already on the watchlist, but they are going to have to compensation buff bilgewater considering the only decks that could be considered meta with bilgewater don't run that package. 

The tavernskeeper change was to bring it to the all important 3 power benchmark, there is a reason there are so many 3/3's out there.",1
"I hope they implement a fixed timer amount per game (like how Duel Links does it, if you guys are familiar). I mean, does anyone else feels like the Timer isn't shorter enough? Does it really refresh each time the player decides to take action? Matches tend to drag on because of this and it's just tiring. The game isn't chess!",1
every region either has fast removal or has other ways to play around it.,1
Other similar cards are also at slow speed (Redoubled Valor comes to mind as the most direct comparison).,0
"Rework: when you stop early burn aggression and spam Braum, he is summoned on your side regardless of the deck",-1
">Burn is dead, the only midrange deck was Demacia and got nerfed really hard so that means control will completely take over.

Nah. One unyielding spirit on that demacia 5/5 lifesteal tough unit completely beats Corinna control. Karma got nerfed too.  So control decks using her got half a turn slower.

>Forgot to mention Will of Ionia is too strong of a tempo play on 4 mana which can be used defensively as offensively.

Only against control decks which kinda refutes your own point to some degree.

>Pilfered Goods is simply wayyyyy too strong.

(~~I feel the worst thing about it is that it also discounts the mana costs of the drawn cards so playing pilfered goods is essentially free and~~) it also has complimentary side effects for Maokai and TF which makes it even better and more frustrating. Imo it should be copies instead of draws ~~or atleast not discount the mana costs~~.",0
"I disagree, it’s a higher risk card now for a high reward.

If youre playing against Control and predict that the opponent didn’t mulligan any 1 drops, you could still play Rearguard for a massive advantage turn 1.",1
"Maybe now. I haven't played in a while but it definitely did not have stats when the game wasn't on life support. I was Diamond rank and I couldn't even see basic stats without uploading my game data to hotslogs and looking there.

I think I know what you mean like basic match history is what you mean I think.",1
"Or only immortal when in combat or attacking via duels, and reducing its cost. That way you still have the demacian preference in combat but can be removed outside battle.",-1
"Completely same..I am also lagging while drafting.. xiaomi mi a3 with Android 10... Did not have the problem before patch

Edit: I do have Avast AV installed and when I disable web shield, then the drafting is smooth. So to me it seems it's AVs error",-1
"Nerfs are more important than buffs, because overpowered cards hurt the meta more than underpowered cards.

But that doesn't mean some buffs wouldn't be nice to see.",-1
"I'm ready for everyone to learn the true terror of Fizz aggro.

That or just more Bannerman again.",0
"Because you're denying it to your opponent. You're still growing your hand size, and while it might not synergize, it's still playable. So you get card advantage while also denying your opponent their synergy.",0
"I feel like Buffs to Braum can easily make him too frustrating to play against. I mean he can be pretty difficult to remove for some decks so buffing him defensively can be devastating to those decks, while giving him offense potential would actually make him pretty dangerous as an assassin who picks off enemy units.",-1
The whole deck got obliterated with multiple nerfs to it and buffs to things that are not it. The deck itself is likely not viable anymore.,-1
People should really stop saying literally,-1
Wow karma costs 1 more mana now.... yeah that should stop her and ezreal hitting my nexus for 20 after spamming mushrooms. Just remove the broken slut.,-1
"The problem with most of the decks isn't the champions or followers (except karma/ezreal/nautilus and heimer) but the insanely low cost spells that draw cards/spells. When you have 2 mana cost that draws 2 enemy cards or two spells with a burst effect. 
Also deep decks problem is : they have lifesteal, insane buffs to most important followers/champions, easy and cheap draw, obliteration, maokai and nautilus insane level up effects and not a single setback. Simply by removing the effect of Nautilus that copies tossed allies back in the deck it will be much fairer. Spells that are burst or cost 1 mana to help the deep effect and then having maokai that obliterates opponents deck and then nautilus copies the strong tossed allies, there isn't a risk for the deck as the rest have.
Lastly heimer's 0 cost units and ezreals burst spells that cost low to help his effects is the problem.",-1
"Going vs Control and not playing the game because every move you do is countered also isn't fun.

Aggro is needed in this game, else Control gets greedier and greedier.",-1
"Well, if they follow the cadence they described previously:

I'd call this patch regularily-sized.  
1.3 is going to be mainly a bugfix patch.  
1.4 is the biggest patch of the Rising Tides cycle. If we're seeing reworks to cards, it will probably be on that patch.  
1.5 is going to be another bugfix patch.  
1.6 is the final balance patch of Rising Tides and should be about the same as 1.2 in size. Around this time, we'll start to see previews of the new cards for the next set as well.",1
Shen change I think is amazing! the difference between being able to and not able to block Fearsome units is incredible! I think that you will be seeing a lot more Shen because of it. A 4 mana 4/6 and super charges minions is an incredible card and Shen has a lot more likely chance to do so now because of it.,1
That's top level jebait.,0
"Use your expedition tokens if you have any, and as long as you do a daily quest like once a week you'll get another in your vault come tuesday. You get 2 shots at building a deck and it'll teach some fundamentals of what to use, though it's not going to give you any optimal lists at least you can get kind of a feel for curve and such. You can make better decks than the free ones for sure, even if you don't have resources to make a really good deck you can make something functional",1
All of these except Will & Deep Fish are only castable on followers.,0
Next patch: cost 6 but refund 1 spell mana after use,0
All of these are fairly reasonable. Nice!,1
"As a new player who crafted it recently, this pleases me. It's such a fun deck",1
"Unyelding meta inc, even better with burn out of the way.",1
Is it finally time for Vlad to shine ? :0,0
What is wrong with Shadowshift?,-1
In all honesty the longer i play the more i want them to rethink the burst spell condition entirely. Burst spells applied to fiora are a big fucking problem for most decks that cannot be dealt with. As the game is now i feel like i am obliged to run ionia purely for 3x will and 3x deny just to even have any kind of control whatsoever. Honestly Fiora's whole win con feels just cheap and shitty to play against unless you already have an answer for it in hand.,1
"Alternatively raise its cost and limit it to followers only.

Or make it at the cost of silencing all the other cards effects.",0
Thank god they nerfed badger and grizzled ranger. They had such oppressive stats for their cost.,0
"I'm fine against it in all of my freljiord decks, and it's not like you will ever go freljiord allegiance.",0
"The 1 health loss on boomcrew was huge, bringing it down to 1 hit for most decks. Now there will be times it doesn't get an attack off. The 1 hp off of rear guard allows all of the 1 dmg removal to get rid of it, and for it to be chumpblocked. It's a bigger hit vs control, which had a bad matchup vs it already. Although certain decks won't get much better against burn, there will be less burn players to deal with so it helps even them.",0
"I mean as a concept it probably should be. Your cards are guaranteed to be synergistic with the rest of your cards. 

If you're stealing cards from like Endure Spiders the best card you're for is an atrocity or an endure just to deny it from your opponent. 

Otherwise you're probably drawing a hapless which is useless, a Wraith Caller you probably won't be able to use, If they're running a vengeance you might get that that'd be sick. But a lot of cards you could take from your opponent aren't necessarily cards you would want, which is the argument to why the cards are fine as is.

I don't agree with that logic 100%, all decks run good cards and my opponent shouldn't just be able to take them from me, but the cards in your deck are always going to be more valuable to you than the cards in their deck.",1
"I think Crimson Awakener doesn't belong in this list. There are probably other, more solid 4 drops. Maybe I'm wrong though.

Skitterer I'm not convinced on either.",-1
"1 power on Shen is huge. He went from a bit below the curve to on-curve, which is very nice.",1

"I really liked the patch overall. Karma should be harder to combo in the same turn, but still strong. Vladmir draining makes so much sense with his character. Some burn nerfs, I feel that's ok (the main one being rookie going down to 3 health). Vi going down to 4 health might be huge, but should still see play. And the nerf I liked the most is the bear going down to 3 attack. 4/4 for 3 mana was ridiculous, although it probably will still see play because it trades so well with almost anything around turn 2/3 and even 4.
