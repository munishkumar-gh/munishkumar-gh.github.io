My goal with this body of work is to determine if (a) I can predict the number of rainfall days 
in a particular month and (b) predict if the total rainy days are <5, between 5-15 or > 15 days in total. 
I will be using data that is measured at the Changi Climate Station.
 
Note that prediction of the "number of rainy days per month" is, in of itself, not very helpful. 
This is because you will need to a priori know the other independent variables 
(as highlighted in the work) before using the developed models to know the number of 
rainfalldays. Still, this work is interesting, if only to learn more about machine learning 
methods and techniques.

In this work, I will showcase the following:

1. Scraping multiple websites,
2. Combining the different data sets into 1 set,
3. Preprocessing i.e. descriptive statistics and deal with missing values,
4. Standardize, shuffling and pickling the data,
5. Different "basic" regression methods (Multilinear, Polynomial, Ridge Regression),
6. Different "advanced" regression methods (K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine),
7. A.I. solution e.g. Neural Net via Tensorflow,

Lets see if (5), (6) or (7) is the best solution\n"
