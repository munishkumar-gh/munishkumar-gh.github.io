Algorithm to interpret HC shows using Light (C1-C5) Hydrocarbon gases from Mud-log Data
1) Hydrocarbon Wetness, Wh (or gas wetness ratio, GWR)
2) Balance Ratio, Bh (or light to heavy ratio, LHR)
3) Character Ratio, Ch (or oil character qualifier, OCQ)
Generates a flag to indicate potential HC show type

Flag = 1 - Very dry gas
Flag = 2 - Medium Density Gas
Flag = 3 - Gas/Oil Zone
Flag = 4 - Medium Gavity Oil 
Flag = 5 - Residual or transition zone
