PROGRAM: RWA_SP_SALINITY_MK

The main features of this program are

1. Computation of cross-plot porosity (PHIX) from Density-Neutron logs. 
2. Calcuation of hydrocarbon corrected cross-plot porosity (PHIT_HC) if light hydrocarbons such as gas is present
3. Calcuation of apparent matrix density (RHOGM) from Density-Neutron logs
4. Calcuation of apparent formation water resistivity or RWA in ohmm
5. Calculation of apparet formation water conductivity or CWA in mhos-m
6. Determination of apparent formation water salinity (SALINITY) in ppm NaCl equivalent
7. Determination of true formation water resistivity or RW from SP
6. Determination of true formation water salinity (SALINITY_SP) in ppm NaCl equivalent

With respect to porosity the programs handles all circumstances for standard porosity logs present 
and situations where some of these are absent or not selected. These include:

1. RHOB, NPHI, DT, RT are present and selected. Under these circumstance, the program calculates the 
- Neutron cross plot porosity and Sonic porosity (PHIA) by Wyllie's or Hunt-Raymer's equation depending on 
the choice of the analyst. The cross-plot porosity is used to calculate RWA, CWA, formation Salinity and apparent 
grain density (RHOGM). If light hydrocarbons such as gas are present, the program also calculates a hydrocarbon 
corrected cross-plot porosity (PHIT_HC)

2. RHOBI,DT and RT are present but NPHI is absent or not selected. In this case a Density porosity is calculated 
from RHOB and input apparent grain density (RHOGA). A Sonic porosity(PHIA) is also calculated using either Wyllie's 
or Hunt-Raymer's equation depending on the analyst's choice. The Density porosity is used to calculate RWA and 
Salinity. 

3. RHOB is absent but DT and RT are present. Sonic porosity (PHIA) is calculated using Wyllie's or Hunt-Raymer's 
equation depending on the analyst's. The Sonic porosity is used to calculate RWA and Salinity.

4. RHOB, RT present but NPHI and DT are absent or not selected. In this case a Density porosity is calcualted 
from an input apparent grain density(RHOGA) and this in turn used to compute RWA and formation salinity.

It should be noted that the cross-plot porosity from the Density-Neutron porosity is equivalent to PHIT in water 
bearing and low GOR oil bearing sands. If RHOB or NPHI are absent, then RHOGM is treated missing.

The program also checks to see if coal or volcanics flag or both available. If they are, the output logs in the 
intervals where either lithology or both are present,are set to the following values:

PHIX = missing
PHIA = missing
PHIT_HC = missing
RWA = missing
CWA = missing
SALINITY = missing
