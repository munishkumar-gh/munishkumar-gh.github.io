A 140 MW Solar Thermal Plant in Jordan,"This paper aims to compute the performances of a smaller version of Solana power plant, with half the solar field, and 1 of 2 turbines in the power cycle, that can be built in Amman or Ma’an in Jordan. The climate conditions for both Amman and Ma’an are discussed thoroughly in the paper. Furthermore, a preliminary validation exercise performed by using measured monthly average values of electricity production from existing plants, a system advisor model (SAM) is used to predict the performances of the proposed Solana-like plants in Ma’an and Amman. The validation shows a good agreement with the measured data for different existing power plants. The simulation results including the monthly capacity factors suggest the annual operation in Ma’an maybe even better than the operation in Gila Bend, for an annual average capacity factor of about 41% for Ma’an vs. a capacity factor of about 39% for Gila Bend. This is mainly due to the best combination of direct normal irradiance (DNI) and the dry bulb temperature across the year in Ma’an versus Gila Bend. The shortcomings of relying on virtual results to economically support the set-up of concentrated solar power plants of certain types is targeted in this paper. That is, with scarce energy and economic resources in Jordan, an unsuccessful concentrated solar power plant could obliterate the future of energy security and energy independence. Therefore, relying on realistic data from built and run plants in the US, and modeling in SAM, it was concluded that concentrated solar power ST plants are considered too risky, economically wise, despite their virtual potential. The only plant in the world utility scale greater than 100 MW built and operational to support the claim of superiority of the concentrated solar power ST with thermal energy storage  technology vs. PT has been recently shut down after only 4 years of life producing every year less than one-quarter of the expected. This has been a total loss of almost 1 billion $US for the US taxpayers [21].
Evidenced by the underperformance of the concentrated solar power ST plants of ISEGS, without thermal energy storage  and with NG boost, and Crescent Dunes, incorporating a 10-hour thermal energy storage , solar only, the latter conclusion was drawn. Moreover, data revealed concentrated solar power PT plants to be more appealing. Capacity factors of concentrated solar power PT plants, without thermal energy storage , solar only, such as Genesis or Mojave Solar Project, are about 30%, close to their design values. Incorporating a six-hour thermal energy storage , and using a larger solar field, the capacity factors of the concentrated solar power PT plant of Solana, solar only, are up to 36%. However, they still have significant differences vs. their design value of 43%. As concentrated solar power ST projects did not achieve the designed capacity factors in the US, there is no reason they can work better in Amman or Ma’an. From the US experience, selecting a concentrated solar power PT design has a better prospect for better performances and reduced costs.
The dispatchability in electricity generation points to an almost certain future direction of thermal energy storage . The choice of technology is the Solana plant with possibly an increase in the capacity of energy storage to 10 h from 6 h to better match the demand after sunset and up to the first hours of the following days. While increasing the capacity of a thermal energy storage  does not affect too much the monthly electricity production, this is necessary for dispatchability. The thermal energy storage  increment is affected by the integration with other electricity sources and the pricing of the electricity.
The choice of Solana is inspired by the fact of being the only plant currently having an advantage on standard PV systems, delivering better annual average capacity factor, which is likely a smaller standard deviation attributed to the role of the thermal energy storage . PV systems can deliver capacity factors in the range of 0.27–0.29 in solar energy facilities, whereas their urban implementation in rooftop installation has lower capacity factors in the range of 0.10–0.15 [27]. The results of SAM when Amman and Ma’an Solana copies were simulated using local environmental conditions demonstrated promising results. In particular, the annual average capacity factors are about 36% in Amman, around 41% in Ma’an in comparison to the one of the optimal places of a solar concentrated solar power; Gila Bend, that achieved about 39%. In the summer, the virtual plants were able to provide energy with thermal energy storage  up to midnight. Local conditions in Ma’an pertaining ability for future expansion to meet ever-increasing energy demands, in addition to the fact that its energy production performance exceeded Amman due to more adequate environmental conditions such as DNI and humidity, promothermal energy storage  it as the optimal place for a concentrated solar power in Jordan. Finally, as the reliability of the models is still minimal, a pilot plant is suggested first, before moving to a full-scale realization.",Processes,,
A fuzzy levelised energy cost method for renewable energy technology assessment,"Renewable energy project development is highly complex and success is by no means guaranteed. Decisions are often made with approximate or uncertain information yet the current methods employed by decision-makers do not necessarily accommodate this. Levelised energy costs (LEC) are one such commonly applied measure utilised within the energy industry to assess the viability of potential projects and inform policy. The research proposes a method for achieving this by enhancing the traditional discounting LEC measure with fuzzy set theory. Furthermore, the research develops the fuzzy LEC (F-LEC) methodology to incorporate the cost of financing a project from debt and equity sources. Applied to an example bioenergy project, the research demonstrates the benefit of incorporating fuzziness for project viability, optimal capital structure and key variable sensitivity analysis decision-making. The proposed method contributes by incorporating uncertain and approximate information to the widely utilised LEC measure and by being applicable to a wide range of energy project viability decisions. The research demonstrated how the traditional crisp LEC method is insufficient in accommodating uncertainty or imprecision and that a solution to this shortcoming is to apply the proposed F-LEC method. It also demonstrates how the F-LEC method can include the terms of finance to give a unit cost that reflects the cost of financing a project. The proposed method for enhancing the traditional discounting LEC calculation can be easily applied to project cash flow projections to ascertain viability and when informing technology and policy decisions. By integrating the terms of project finance into the F-LEC, it is also useful to project sponsors and financiers as an alternative or additional measure to the IRR in cases of uncertainty and vagueness. A 20 year operational lifecycle is shown for both examples but this may differ depending on the energy project type. A change in the operational lifecycle will affect the levelised energy costs as there is a greater or shorter period to generate revenue and break-even. There may also be changes to the terms of finance with an example being the duration of dividend pay-outs and return to the equity investor.

The fuzzy method is an alternative to probabilistically calculating the LEC and potentially better suited when there is limited or approximate information held by decision-makers. Furthermore, the method, without incorporating the finance terms, does not employ an iterative process as required for the stochastic Monte-Carlo method. A non-iterative process such as the proposed fuzzy method is computationally quicker than a Monte-Carlo approach, for example the Darling et al. (2011) study utilised 1 million iterations of the calculation to produce each final solution. Additionally, the fuzzy set outputs explicitly display the consequences of uncertainty in the inputs, whereas probabilistic outputs may incorporate this into a single confidence level output variable.

An example of the application to a bioenergy project is given within the research but the method can be applied to a wide range of energy projects with or without the integration of the terms and cost of financing. The method can enhance the level of information presented to decision-makers by including uncertainty and this is demonstrated with the capital structure and sensitivity analysis outputs as well as with the LEC calculation. The surveyed practitioners clearly felt that this is beneficial to them in the early stages of project development. It is also possible with this type of method to track reductions in uncertainty held by decision-makers as they progress through the development of the project and a function's ‘fuzziness’ may reduce over time.

The demonstrated method gives an alternative approach to modelling discount rates when there is limited information available to decision-makers. The concerns of Awerbuch, 2006 cited Heptonstall (2007) are also less contentious when uncertainty and variance in forecasting the discount rate and other variables are incorporated into the F-LEC calculation. Fuzzy discount rate mapping with the α-cuts method replicates the many possible outcomes of variable discount rates within the fuzzy set output over the project duration. This is not an exclusive capability of the fuzzy approach but it is beneficial to the typical deterministic approach. Similarly to Ang, Huang [16], the applied method also demonstrates that the minimum LEC and in turn break-even point is highly dependent on the discount rate applied and project capital structure. Further developments of the F-LEC calculation could introduce more complex fuzzy set function mapping such as asymmetrical distributions known as L-R type functions as first proposed by Dubois and Prade (1978). The impact of more complex and potentially non-linear fuzzy input functions in place of the triangular one demonstrated within the research on the output variable depends on the significance of the input function in the F-LEC calculation.",Energy Policy,,
A qualitative factor analysis of renewable energy and Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) in the Asia-Pacific,"This study assesses the factors responsible for the success and failure of renewable energy access programs in Bangladesh, China, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea. Based on 441 research interviews over the course of four years, site visits to 90 renewable energy facilities, and focus groups with almost 800 community members in 10 countries, this study develops a series of overarching qualitative factors that correlate with programs that met their targets, sometimes ahead of schedule, and produced measurable benefits exceeding costs. The inverse of these factors is associated with programs that did not meet their targets, were behind schedule, and/or produced measurable costs exceeding benefits. It concludes by offering 10 lessons for energy analysts and development practitioners concerning appropriate technology, income generation, financing, political leadership, capacity building, programmatic flexibility, marketing and awareness, stakeholder engagement, community ownership, and technical standardization. Despite these caveats and suggestions for future research, the data from these 10 case studies strongly imply best practices for program design. Successful partnerships actively promote community participation and ownership. They couple energy services with income generation and employment, and they distribute responsibilities among different institutional partners, involving a diversity of important stakeholders. They choose appropriate technologies matched in quality and scale to the energy service desired, often with direct input from communities and users themselves. They do not “give away” renewable energy technologies or over-subsidize technology or research. Successful partnerships do not take consumer awareness about renewable energy for granted and, instead, direct resources at knowledge dissemination, marketing and promotion. Effective partnerships strongly emphasize after sales service and maintenance, ensuring that technologies are cared for by rural populations or technicians.

We know that the inclusion of multiple stakeholders in program design, implementation, and evaluation can enhance the efficacy of renewable energy deployment. The involvement of women’s groups, multilateral donors, rural cooperatives, local government, manufacturers, nongovernmental organizations and other members of civil society, and even consumers, can increase both the performance and legitimacy of partnerships. They improve performance since input from multiple stakeholders can accelerate feedback; they improve legitimacy since programs with a broader base of support, and community involvement, are less likely to be opposed, protested, or even attacked physically during civil wars and internal conflicts.

We know that the most effective way to expand access to renewable energy through partnerships necessitates a shift in how most development practitioners conceive of energy technology and program structure. Effective partnerships emphasize markets and energy services for customers, rather than technologies. They go beyond merely equipment supply to assess income generation, applications, and user foci. They consider the economic viability of renewable energy technology as only one piece of the puzzle alongside policy formation, financing, institutional capacity, and social needs. They usually require national or local champions, either in the form of institutions or individuals. Successful programs share not only the rewards of building sustainable renewable energy markets, but also the risks. Practitioners, and those interested in energy development, could start by shifting how they conceive of energy technology and program structure to focus on the “Sustainable Program Paradigm” in Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, we know that investments in renewable energy bring benefits that far exceed their costs. In some cases these include improvements to household income and standards of living, in others productivity and community development. In others they bring technological reliability and quality, and reductions in cost. In still others they encompass significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions and rates of deforestation. Investments in renewable energy technologies and programs represent one of those rare cases where not only households and small enterprises benefit, but also companies, regulators, and society at large. Particular experiences will always differ according to culture and context, yet when designed appropriately, renewable energy access programs can quickly and effectively accelerate the adoption of cleaner technologies in the areas of the world that most urgently need them.
Selecting appropriate technology through feasibility studies and surveys that, by asking local users what they want, are able to identify community needs and desirable energy services;

•
Coupling renewable energy with income generating activities and partnering with livelihood groups such as farmers and crop processors, small businesses, restaurants, and community cooperatives;
Providing access to financing and microcredit to overcome the first cost hurdle with purchasing systems;
Having political leadership and a requisite alignment of national and local policies;
Building capacity and investing in local institutions rather than merely providing technology;
Being flexible in terms of deadlines and changing circumstances, including the avoidance of promoting technology selected only by donors;
Conducting outreach and marketing campaigns and research to ensure that economic, social, and policy issues are addressed alongside traditional engineering and environmental aspects;
Encouraging active participation (and feedback) from communities, essentially creating as much interaction among designers, producers, and users as possible;
Avoiding giving away systems for free and instead requiring community contributions and cost-sharing;
Enforcing technical standards and certifications so units, components, installation practices, and maintenance procedures are all sufficient to ensure reliable system operation.",Energy Policy,,
A Review of Factors Influencing the Success of Community Renewable Energy Minigrids in Developing Countries,"Minigrids are expected by the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative to
play a significant role in ensuring universal energy access. Despite this, there are a range of
technical, organisational, social and financial barriers to their successful deployment,
including lack of community integration, unrealistic user expectations and poor local
maintenance capabilities. Community Renewable Energy Minigrids (Community Renewable Energy Minigrids) are expected to
increase community engagement and therefore potentially mitigate some of these problems,
improving outcomes when compared to minigrids with other ownership and operation
structures. Community Renewable Energy Minigrids are also likely to offer other important socioeconomic benefits and
improved rural livelihoods. However, a range of challenges for existing Community Renewable Energy Minigrids are reported
in the literature. Specific barriers include the need for extensive liaison (e.g. community
engagement), technology choice risks, controversies around governance of benefits and,
often, non-existing technical and organizational local capabilities. At this stage, it is not clear
which implementation models or community capabilities are required to overcome these
challenges. This paper will present a review of recent experiences, exploring the factors that
influence the success of Community Renewable Energy Minigrids, which might require special input and attention by
practitioners, donors, and community activists in order to deliver a sustainable and successful
Community Renewable Energy M. Minigrids are expected to make a significant contribution to solving the energy
poverty issue worldwide. There is also increasing recognition of the role of community-led
development. The United States Agency for International Development has refocused its
donor efforts “… toward realizing a vision of development that is locally owned, locally led
and locally sustained (pg.iii)” (USAID, 2014).
In addition to increasing rural energy access, Community Renewable Energy
Minigrids, Community Renewable Energy Minigrids, have been shown to derive additional benefits for local development. In
particular, Community Renewable Energy Minigrids may be beneficial for changing social attitudes towards RE technologies,
improving energy reliability and costs, increasing local income generation, community
empowerment and local capability building. The latter outcome can ultimately have the most
impact, as development of a community’s capabilities might maximize system technical
sustainability, as well as lead to new projects in other sectors; e.g. water, education, health,
and agroindustry.
However, a number of challenges have been identified for Community Renewable Energy Minigrids. Obstacles can be
seen from two perspectives: for existing and new projects. For current Community Renewable Energy Minigrids, lack of
extensive local engagement, efficient information channels among stakeholders, and effective
means of dispute resolution, have been identified as barriers that can put at risk the project as
a whole. In addition, once the funds are available in the community to implement the RE
system, the long-term financial operation can be in danger if the owners overlook lessons
learned from previous Community Renewable Energy Minigrids, such as inadequately estimating O&M costs, or setting an
inappropriate energy price. Controversies around governance of revenues have also revealed
that additional know-how is still required in terms of organization and negotiation for social
structures in charge of Community Renewable Energy Minigrids.
On the other hand, for future projects, it is important for community leaders to
carefully analyse the benefits and costs of different ownership and operation models. In
general, the implicit complexity of hybrid structures, when compared to Community Renewable Energy M approaches,
will demand higher levels of local managerial, technical and operational capabilities, which at
times are not accessible.
This study set out to identify reported success factors in Community Renewable Energy Minigrids recently deployed in
developing countries. From the selected case study literature, critical factors influencing the
success or failure were identified. These are summarised in Figure 1, with most relevant
causes playing a pivotal role to the success of Community Renewable Energy Minigrids as follows:
1. Sense of ownership: the higher the sense of rights and responsibilities towards the RE
system, the higher the likelihood of achievement;
2. Community capability building: effective and continued training efforts must include
at a minimum, capabilities for social organization, legal structure creation, project
management, financial management and technology operation management; 3. RE technology selection and sizing: an accurate load assessment, together with
adequate system sizing and configuration, is fundamental as it will impact positively
on the financial viability and allow implementation of effective O&M practices and
costs;
4. On-going O&M and troubleshooting: often Community Renewable Energy Minigrids need to survive in remote and low
population density areas. If the operation is not supported by local people with
volunteer and other in-kind contributions for non-technical maintenance and follow up
activities, O&M can be compromised by this remoteness; and
5. Energy service reliability: poor technical system performance, e.g. fewer hours of
access and availability, unexpected blackouts and power quality issues, will lead to
unmet overall user expectations. If service levels are high, then customer satisfaction
is high and tangible positive outcomes can be achieved.
It has been stated that “one of the main gaps in the literature relates to inadequacy of
information about successful mini-grid examples (p, 395)” (Bhattacharyya and Palit, 2014).
Furthermore, there is no common framework of analysis and appraisal for Community Renewable Energy Minigrids (Kumar, et
al., 2009, Bhattacharyya, 2012). In addition to improving understanding of factors influencing
success in existing Community Renewable Energy Minigrids, the findings from this study can be used to inform project
planning and design to maximise the sustainability of future projects, and form a basis for
future research.
The preliminary findings suggest that: 1) we need to know more about appropriate
ownership-operator models for Community Renewable Energy Minigrids under different rural settings in the developing world;
2) it is necessary to understand effective community capability building processes, as the
challenges and requirements for capability building and engagement are skills not well
understood or covered in the literature; and 3) there is a need to develop suitable sustainability
assessment frameworks supporting the monitoring and evaluation of Community Renewable Energy M outcomes. This
review will serve as a basis for future work, in order to establish suitable implementation
models and the requirements for success of Community Renewable Energy Minigrids in different contexts. ",Asia-Pacific Solar Research Conference,,
"An empirical analysis of the non-linear impacts of ICT-trade openness on renewable energy transition, energy efficiency, clean cooking fuel access and environmental sustainability in South Asia ","Energy security and environmental sustainability have become an integral policy agenda worldwide whereby the global economic growth policies are being restructured to ensure the reliability of energy supply and safeguard environmental well-being as
well. However, technological inefficiency is one of the major hindrances in attaining these over-arching goals. Hence, this paper
probed into the non-linear impacts of ICT trade on the prospects of undergoing renewable energy transition, improving energy
use efficiencies, enhancing access to cleaner cooking fuels, and mitigating carbon dioxide emissions across selected South Asian
economies: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Maldives. The results from the econometric analyses reveal that
ICT trade directly increases renewable energy consumption, enhances renewable energy shares, reduces intensity of energy use,
facilitates adoption of cleaner cooking fuels, and reduces carbon-dioxide emissions. Moreover, ICT trade also indirectly mitigates
carbon-dioxide emissions through boosting renewable energy consumption levels, improving energy efficiencies, and enhancing
cleaner cooking fuel access. Hence, these results, in a nutshell, portray the significance of reducing the barriers to ICT trade with
respect to ensuring energy security and environmental sustainability across South Asia. Therefore, it is ideal for the government
to gradually lessen the trade barriers to boost the volumes of cross-border flows of green ICT commodities. Besides, it is also
recommended to attract foreign direct investments for the potential development of the respective ICT sectors of the South Asian
economies. Ensuring energy security and environmental sustainability has
gradually become a core concern across the globe whereby the
global economic growth policies, from a more comprehensive
perspective, are gradually being aligned with complementary
strategies that simultaneously safeguard the reliable supply of
energy resources and also improve the overall quality of the
world environment. More often than not, technological innovation is a pre-requisite for the attainment of these aforementioned multidimensional growth policies. Given the vast divide in respect of technological advancement between the first
and the third world countries, implementation of such comprehensive growth policies becomes relatively cumbersome
for the developing economies; courtesy of technological constraints faced. Against this backdrop, this paper attempted to
reason the justification behind the liberalization of barriers to
ICT trade for ensuring energy security and environmental sustainability across selected South Asian economies:
Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and
Maldives. The overall findings from the econometric analyses, in a nutshell, reveal two crucial findings. First, enhancing
ICT-trade openness is found to exert direct impacts to facilitate RET, improve energy use efficiencies, enhance access to
cleaner cooking fuels and technologies, and reduce CO2 emissions. The associated relationships are mostly non-linear and
also confirm the beneficial roles of enhancing ICT trade in this
regard. Second, ICT trade also exhibits an indirect impact on
reducing CO2 emissions through its direct impacts on RET,
energy efficiency improvement, and enhanced access to cleaner cooking fuels. Besides, the results also led to the key
finding that CO2 emissions across South Asia are conditional
on the nature of the energy resources consumed since consumption of RE is found to curb the per capita CO2 emission
levels while NRE consumption was seen to aggravate the
emission further.
Therefore, in line with the overall findings from this paper,
it is recommended that the governments of the concerned
South Asian economies gradually liberalize the trade barriers
that inhibit cross-border flows of ICT goods and services.
Simultaneously, effective measures should be undertaken to
incentivize the use of RE resources and reduce the predominant use of NRE. Moreover, since the impacts of ICT on CO2
emissions are found to be largely conditional on the types of
energy resources consumed, liberalization of the barriers
should be designed meticulously so that it favors trade of the
relatively greener ICT commodities that have the capacity
incorporating and operating on energy sourced from RE resources and are also comparatively energy-efficient which, in
turn, could be credible means to safeguard both the energy
security and environmental sustainability goals across South
Asia. Besides, restructuring of the foreign investment policies
should also be considered for attracting foreign direct investments into the ICT sectors of the South Asian economies
which, in turn, would be effective in developing these sectors
through a knowledge spillover effect associated with such
foreign investments. Furthermore, decentralization of the
existing energy systems in several of the South Asian economies, especially Bangladesh, whereby the use of ICT-enabled
off-grid renewable electrification can be a solution to the low
rural electrification rates across South Asia. In this regard,
provision for the smartening of the existing grids and incentives through the use of ICT can also overcome the prevailing
in-grid inefficiencies to reduce power transmission and distribution losses.
As part of the future scope of research, this analysis
can be extended by further disaggregating ICT-trade
openness in ICT commodity-specific openness to assess
the potential heterogeneity of the impacts. It is pertinent
to do so because although a plethora of the existing studies have probed into the impacts of ICT goods, especially
Internet and mobile subscriptions on RET, energy efficiency and CO2 emissions, little is known in the context
of the dynamic impacts associated with the liberalization
of the barriers that restrict the trade of these key ICT
goods. Besides, the incorporation of different energy resources and diverse indicators of environmental quality
into the analysis would provide the overall robustness of
the findings. Furthermore, this analysis of the impacts of
ICT trade on energy security and environmental sustainability can also be performed for other regions and
country-specific cases.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,
Assessing Turkey's Climate Change Commitments: The Case of Turkey's Energy Policy.,"Climate change is increasingly recognized worldwide as a growing threat. The UN's sustainable development goals and the Paris Conference (COP 21) attest to this. Countries confront the challenge of managing the trade-off between energy-intensive growth and climate change effects. In this historical juncture, a renewable energy- based third industrial revolution is underway. In the post-COP 21 period, it is now imperative to analyze the (non)-compliance of signatories to their commitments towards climate action. Turkey is no exception to this trend. In this light, this paper examines the credibility of Turkey's compliance with its commitments at the COP 21 with special focus on the public attitudes in Turkey towards climate change and the government's (non)-adoption of climate action as a norm in its energy strategy documents and its energy policy practices. It concludes that regardless of Turkey's COP 21 commitments and public perceptions on climate change, Turkish policy makers prioritize availability in its energy policy to foster economic growth. At a time of “third industrial revolution” based on sustainable energy technologies and emergence of climate change as an international norm,particularly following the UNSDGs and COP21, countries have been faced with the daunting task of decarbonizing their energy-intensive growth. Assuming that it is high time to discern those COP21 signatories’ energy policies, the main contention of this paper has been to discuss thecredibility of Turkey’s commitment to take climate action through its energy policies. We argued that regardless of its COP21 commitments and high  public support for climate action,Turkey has been maintaining carbonintense energy policies as usual.As stated in the actual strategic report
of the Ministry, energy intense sectors of iron-steel and cement have been playing dominant roles in the Turkish economy. Moreover, there are findings about the existing negative correlation between local coal development and unemployment figures.68 Nonetheless, increasing the country’s fossil fuel supplies through local coal is not the sustainable option for Turkey. Considering Turkey’s fossil fuel basedenergy intense economy, it should be noted that instead of giving priority to fossil fuel supplies, scientific studies have proposed that Turkey could make a policy shift by emphasizing energy efficiency and renewable energy development so that it can reducefossil fuel demand without disrupting prospects for sustainable development.69 Hence, the government can accomplish two objectives through one effort to create a properly functioning energy efficiency policy: 1) bolstering prospects for an economic model with less energy use, and 2) promoting sustainable green development, thereby addressing domestic and international climate change concerns. In this parallel, the İstanbul Policy Center 2015 report  titled “Low Carbon DevelopmentPathways and Priorities for Turkey” proposes that a “green growth” approach is both adequate and economically feasible for Turkey.70 Having watchedthe Britain-led industrial revolution of the 19th century and the US-led automated assembly line revolution in the 20th century from the sidelines,as Prof. Yeldan puts it, Turkey with its abundant renewable energy potential can become one of the forerunners of “the third industry revolution” of the 21st century.71 ","PERCEPTIONS,",,
Attitudes and Approaches of Finnish Retrofit Industry Stakeholders toward Achieving Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings,"Key stakeholders in industry are highly responsible for achieving energy performance targets. Particularly, this paper assesses the attitudes, approaches, and experiences of Finnish construction professionals regarding energy-efficient buildings, or nZEBs. A three-tier investigation was conducted including surveys and expert interviews with several stakeholders. The structure of this approach was informed by preliminary data and information available on the Finnish construction sector. The questionnaire showed that the stakeholders ranked energy efficiency and embodied energy/carbon as very important. The survey highlighted that the importance of the embodied carbon CO2 in the materials is less important than the energy efficiency from many of the stakeholders’ points of view. “Energy efficiency” is very important for ESCOs, contractors, and facility managers followed by architects, HVAC engineers, and construction design engineers. Nevertheless, the opinions of architects ranked “embodied energy CO2” as the most important regarding nZEB. When it comes to the importance of “running time emissions” toward nZEB, contractors and ESCO companies ranked it as 1 for importance followed by property owners (78%) and tenants (75%). It is very fascinating to see from the survey that “running time carbon emissions” has been ranked 1 (very important) by all stakeholders. This study will enable construction industry stakeholders to make provisions for overcoming the barriers, gaps, and challenges identified in the practices of the nZEB projects. It will also inform the formulation of policies that drive retrofit uptake. The aim of this paper is to identify the attitudes, approaches, and experiences of Finnish construction professionals regarding energy-efficient buildings, particularly nZEBs. To accomplish this, we used a two-tier approach: (a) an online survey questionnaire methodology and (b) interviews with the personnel, which considered various users segment groups, in the financial community and among sellers. Questions for the questionnaire are divided into four different categories: the individual perspective, the SDGs perspective, the materials’ embodied carbon perspective, and the market energy-efficiency perspective. The total number of the respondents was 60. Approximately 35% of the respondents were in the age range of 36–46 followed by the age group of 47–57 with 32%. Most of the participants as stakeholders were HVAC engineers (16%), followed by the largest group of participants, construction design engineers (15%) and property owners (11%). The other largest groups were ESCOs (12%), builders (11%), architects (10%), tenants, facility managers, and contractors with 7% each.
6.1. Stakeholders Attitudes toward Importance of Energy Efficiency and Embodied CO2
The results show that the importance of the embodied carbon CO2 in the materials is less important than the energy efficiency from the stakeholder’s point of view. Figure 9 highlights that “energy efficiency” is very important for ESCOs, contractors, and facility managers followed by architects, HVAC engineers, and construction design engineers.
When it comes to the responses of the importance of the “embodied energy CO2” toward nearly zero energy buildings (refer to Figure 10), the survey results highlighted that for architects, the importance of the embodied energy CO2 ranked the highest. Figure 11 further shows that 83.3% of architects ranked 1 (very important) and 16.7% of them ranked 2 (which is important). As the architects are the designers of the buildings, embodied CO2 makes sense for them. However, it seems that for other stakeholders e.g., facility managers, tenants, property managers, and ESCOs, the importance of the embodied carbon is rather unimportant. It can be concluded from this result that these stakeholders might not be properly aware of the significance of embodied carbon in materials.
Several studies highlight that embodied carbon makes up between 27 and 58% of lifecycle carbon emissions [49]. In terms of building components, Hughes and Winter [50] have shown that the selection of the structural frame system has a more significant influence on the embodied carbon and cost than other building components such as (structural frame, inner components (i.e., insulation and sheathing). Hence, it is very important for the stakeholders to understand the importance of expressing and understanding the diversity of the materials.
6.2. Usage of the UN Sustainable Goals in Your Work
Figure 13 shows the breakup of the individual stakeholder’s usage of the UN sustainable goals. It highlights that the architects, HVAC engineers, and property owners are the ones who consider the most usage of UN sustainable goals. This justifies the results from Q7 (where architects indicate the importance of embodied carbon in the material), as the building materials can contribute significantly to the achievement of UN goals [51]. The results presented in this research [52] proved that building materials can contribute significantly to the achievement of the 13 goals and 25 targets of the SDGs. The framework showed that a direct positive contribution of building materials on the SDGs has been noticed in SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 15. However, the survey taken in this research study shows that the respondents do not have much knowledge about the UN goals, and 75.6% of the respondents (refer Figure 12) do not use UN goals in their work.
6.3. Importance of Carbon Neutrality Reaching the nZEB
Q10 assesses the stakeholder’s attitudes and approaches toward carbon neutrality in the building sector. This question was subdivided into ranking the opinion toward the most important actions in reaching the carbon neutrality targeting the building sector. The important actions were listed as follows: (1) embodied carbon in materials, (2) running time carbon emissions, (3) both embodied and running time carbon emissions, (4) the use of renewable energies, and (5) the use of smart technologies for reducing running time carbon emissions.
Overall, the tenants, HVAC engineers, architects, and the ESCOs among the overall stakeholders seem aware of the nZEBs. In terms of the use of renewable energy (Q10) in nZEBs, tenants, HVAC engineers, architects, and ESCOs have listed it as the most important.
The reason behind the awareness could be the direct involvement in the construction of the buildings. However, property owners, facilities managers, construction design engineers, builders, and contractors ranked the usage of renewable energies as rather unimportant. Nevertheless, when it comes to the knowledge of energy efficiency, the survey [51] highlighted that most of the respondents consider renewable energy technologies (Ts) such as solar PV as one the energy-efficiency options among others such as solar hot water, nuclear power, power plant, wind energy, solar power plants, etc.
Renewable energy policies are necessary for achieving carbon neutrality, which is the main goal for climate change mitigation. The cities in the Helsinki metropolitan area have pledged themselves, through different initiatives on climate change and several measures for renewable energy utilization, to substantially reduce emissions of carbon [47]. However, the findings of [47] show that current renewable energy policies in the Helsinki metropolitan area are weak and many challenges exist. Nevertheless, numerous options to strengthen current practices are available.
The research study concludes that in the case of net zero energy buildings, the main impact occurs due to the building materials and technologies installed on the site [53].

Beginning Consolidation in the Renewable Energy Industry and Bidders’ M & A-Success,"In this paper we examine stock price reactions to mergers and acquisitions in a particular industry, the renewable energy industry. We focus on acquirers and document positive abnormal returns on a sample of 337

M&A-transactions in the rapidly growing renewable
energy industry. We focus on acquirer effects and document positive returns on a sample of 337 transactions
completed between January 2000 and October 2009. We
read this as shareholder approval of a healthy consolidation in an emerging industry where larger players are
more likely to extract efficiency gains and exert influence on politics. External growth is seen as an increased
likelihood of being among the future winners of a still
fragmented industry.
We document that acquirers from outside the industry
earn positive abnormal returns when diversifying their
activities towards renewable energy. We interpret this as
a positive signal to shareholders about the sustainability
of returns. Diversified acquirers can spread this ‘green
premium’ over non-green assets. We further show that
the size of the acquirer and its market-to-book ratio correlate negatively with acquirer returns. This corresponds
to the notion that large, high market-to-book firms’ acquisitions are more likely to be motivated by other reasons than shareholder wealth. These firms need to carefully select target firms and trade off external growth
with profitability. ",Technology and Investment,,
Bioenergy Villages and Regions in Germany: An Interview Study with Initiators of Communal Bioenergy Projects on the Success Factors for Restructuring the Energy Supply of the Community,"Because of the serious problems related to an energy supply based mainly on fossil and nuclear fuels, the development of renewable energy sources is urgently needed. In Germany, many villages and communities take energy production into their own hands, following the principle of a community-related energy supply. Today, approximately 50 villages or communities in Germany have restructured their energy consumption patterns to rely primarily on locally available renewable energy sources for their electricity and heat. This article describes a qualitative interview study concerning the success factors for the implementation of bioenergy villages. The interviews were conducted with 25 individuals who initiated the restructuring of energy production in their villages toward bioenergy and other renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind energy. The motives for the engagement of the initiators in the investigated villages are multifaceted. Using the classification of Stern et al. (1993) [16], biocentric motives (ecological reasons) dominated, but often in connection with other motives, such as anthropocentric motives (social reasons) and egocentric motives. The diversity of initiators’ personal motives for the engagement in communal renewable bioenergy projects confirms the findings of Doerner (1999) [17] that a motive mix determines ecologically minded action. The majority of the interviewees intend to protect the climate and nature, to care for the next generations or to create regional value. These experiences are consistent with the findings of an interview study by Eigner-Thiel (2005) on the bioenergy village project in Juehnde. Also, similar experiences in Great Britain show that many of the individuals involved in leading projects concerning locally owned sustainable energy use have been driven by ethical and environmental commitment [18,19,20].
The reports of increased well-being as a consequence of engaging in the creation of a sustainable energy supply support patterns from questionnaire data that show positive correlations between sustainability life goals and well-being [21]. This data pattern may encourage people who still assume that engaging in new lifestyle patterns may diminish well-being.
Each inhabitant has different reasons for participating in a communal renewable energy project. One successful way to create awareness is to convey a holistic message that the project can achieve a variety of objectives. For example, it is important to emphasize the harmony between environmental protection and the creation of economic value. According to these findings, Jenssen (2011) considered the development of overall concepts as an important element of participation [22].
An early involvement of villagers in the planning and organization process increases the chances of success. The inhabitants can contribute their own competencies and knowledge, and the tasks can be spread across many shoulders. In some of the examined villages, working groups were founded along the lines of the Juehnde model [6,23].
Whitmarsh et al. 2011 also recommend an early information and participation process to increase the public acceptance of renewable energy projects. Especially, they emphasize a two-way information exchange, whereby the public not only learns about energy research developments, but also provides answers about the social robustness of technologies and innovations [24].
Congruent with the findings of Eigner-Thiel 2005, interviewees identified face-to-face contacts and personal conversations to mobilize villagers and convince people or skeptics as important success factors. For conveying the initial information about the project, village meetings are suitable. Later in the process, new information and issues that arise during the course of the project can be presented in village meetings.
The principle of transparency is eminently important during the information and communication process. This conforms to the findings of Walker et al. 2008, which showed the importance of trust between local people and groups that take projects forward [25]. Also, Zoellner et al. 2008 showed that the transparency of the implementation process is relevant. Therefore, citizens are opposed to a realization when they are not involved in the planning and decision-making processes [26].
Another successful way of informing, inspiring and persuading people is to visit well-established model projects. This is consistent with the findings of the bioenergy village project Juehnde (Eigner-Thiel, 2005).
Another very important factor for the implementation of a bioenergy village project is political support. In particular, support from the local council and the mayor is necessary for successful progress. In some cases, the projects were regarded as flagship projects, making it easier to get subsidies and permission for construction. This is congruent to the findings of Musall and Kuik (2011). He showed that the support and the engagement from the mayor in a small town in East Germany had contributed to the successful realization of a wind farm owned by local citizens [27].
Considering that the initiators and participants in such communal bioenergy projects are working voluntarily (or in an honorary capacity), stronger support from institutionalized advisory bodies (authorizing body) is helpful.
With regard to the projects’ consequences for individuals and communities, this interview study confirmed the experiences previously observed in the Juehnde bioenergy village [9,28], but with a much broader empirical base. In the majority of the examined bioenergy villages, an improved sense of togetherness, well-being and identification with the village was observed.
Furthermore, the positive economic effects after the implementation of the projects were also found by Mangoyana (2011). According to his findings, decentralized bioenergy projects have the potential to create employment and the resulting income [29].
6. Outlook
In the context of our ongoing research project, “Sustainable use of bioenergy: bridging climate protection, nature conservation and society”, we support the three model districts of Wolfenbuettel, Goslar and the region Hannover on their way to integrative bioenergy regions. In these model regions, we conduct planning workshops with a variety of different actors on a strategic level. Participants include politicians, farmers, mayors, conservationists and people from the district’s administration.
In this context, the results (success factors) of the interview study in the 25 communal renewable energy projects were presented in a planning workshop in the district Wolfenbuettel. On the basis of these experiences and the experiences of the bioenergy villages of the Goettingen district, an initiative arose from workshop participants to convince the district government of Wolfenbuettel to provide financial and political support for the development of bioenergy villages in their own district. Regarding the important impact of visiting model projects, politicians from the district have been invited by our team to a best-practice tour to the bioenergy villages Barlissen, Krebeck and Wollbrandshausen in the district Goettingen. As a consequence, the initiative succeeded in securing a fund for starting a bioenergy village support process in the district.",Sustainability,,
Building Energy Commons: Three Mini-PV Installation Cases in Apartment Complexes in Seoul,"Solar photovoltaics (PV) deployment is not easy in dense urban areas because there is little space for the installation. Furthermore, tenants have few incentives to install PV panels because they frequently relocate, and most PV facilities are nonremovable. To address these factors, this study reports on an innovative model that collectively installed 260 W of mini-PV on the balconies of almost all the households in two high-rise apartment complexes in Seoul, South Korea. This project was unique in that it established energy commons in a community using private space. This study found that economic and social factors significantly influenced community-internal or micro factors, which in turn affected the success of the community energy project. Economic factors such as the expected economic benefit and residents paying no direct installation costs shaped the initial conditions for the commencement of the project. Leadership played a key role by speeding up the process, relieving residents’ concerns and distrust. This study introduced an innovative community energy model that can be referenced by megacities and communities. It provides opportunities for enhancing awareness of energy transition via on-site energy production using renewable energy and allows even communities that have insufficient common space to build energy commons. This study analyzed community energy projects that collectively installed a very small-scale PV with a capacity of 260 W on the balconies of individual households in high-rise apartment complexes in Seoul, South Korea. This is unique in that the projects established energy commons by using private space, unlike other community energy projects. This study introduced an innovative community energy model that can be referenced by megacities and communities, which creates opportunities to enhance awareness of energy transition via on-site energy production using renewable energy and allows communities, even those with insufficient common space, to build energy commons.
The contextual analysis of two successful cases and one suspended case, with a focus on the community-internal (or micro) factors that affected the success of the community energy project, allows us to find significant influence from economic and social factors of internal factors on the project. Economic factors, such as the expected economic benefit and no installation cost being directly paid by residents, shaped the initial conditions for the commencement of the project. Leadership played a key role across the whole project by speeding up the process, relieving residents’ concerns and distrust. The leader whose role was a practitioner, the office manager, was the most important. In contrast, weak leadership could not solve the unforeseen challenges that emerged in the suspended case.
Although this study focused more on community-internal factors, the scaling up or mainstreaming of this project needs external enabling conditions as well. Ruggiero et al. [2] emphasized the importance of intermediary organizations for scaling up or mainstreaming [1]. In addition, the existence of strong incentives or education and training could help community leaders more actively engage in or be more empowered in community energy initiatives.",Energies,,
Change-actors in the U.S. electric energy system: The role of environmental groups in utility adoption and diffusion of wind power,"We study the contribution of environmental groups to new technology adoption and diffusion by dominant incumbents. Building on institutional and social movement theory, we develop a theoretical framework that sheds light on environmental groups as change-actors. We theorize that by approaching embedded key constituents with various strategic actions, environmental groups affect taken-for-granted beliefs, build legitimacy for renewable energy technologies, and convince skeptical constituents to support the new technology. We verify our theoretical framework with a case study of wind power development in Colorado. We find that environmentalists educate constituents on the benefits of the new technology, engage in activities leading to regulatory and legislative decisions for wind, while also providing direct assistance to the utility. As a result, utilities are both pressured and encouraged to adopt and diffuse wind power on a large-scale. This research directs attention to the role of environmental groups as change-actors and the legitimating effects of their actions. It highlights their part in creating a more favorable institutional environment for new technologies while directly influencing the incumbent׳s technology choice. This paper contributes to an understanding of bottom-up, actor-initiated changes in energy systems taking into account both the systemic technological infrastructure and the institutional context. The purpose of this paper is to study the environmental groups′ ability and strategic actions in contributing to the adoption and diffusion of RET by incumbent utilities, while taking into account the systemic technological infrastructure of the U.S. electric energy system, the role of other important field constituents as well as institutional barriers to new technology diffusion. We take an institutional perspective and develop a theoretical framework to shed light on environmental groups as change-actors and their role in introducing and building legitimacy for alternative technologies among skeptical field constituents. Central to our theoretical framework is the assumption that environmental groups, by introducing the new technology to relevant field constituents such as legislators, regulators, and consumers, and by engaging in strategic legitimating actions, create a more favorable regulative and socio-cognitive institutional environment, which contributes to new technology diffusion through incumbent firms. The findings from our case study indicate that Colorado's environmental groups took initiatives regarding the technological choice of utility generated electricity, assessed wind as the most appropriate technological alternative to Colorado's highly fossil fuel dependent electricity portfolio, and spent substantial resources and time in convincing skeptical field constituents to support the new technology. They participated in field processes to firstly bring forward the idea of utility-scale wind power, approached relevant field constituents proactively and persistently, and eventually succeeded in convincing them of the appropriateness of the new practice. In particular, our case shows that environmental groups started to introduce wind technology to central field constituents at a time when it was barely considered as a potential and viable alternative to fossil fuels. In order to build support for the new technology, they actively informed state regulators about the environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness of wind technology, leading to regulatory decisions for wind. They also collaborated with Colorado's legislators which fostered the establishment of an RPS mandate and educated Colorado's electricity consumers about the benefits of wind technology, resulting in a growing awareness of energy choice and demand for wind powered electricity. While this case may be exceptionally successful, it indicates that the environmental groups′ strategic actions resulted in increasing legitimacy for the new technology among central field participants and led to changes in the prevalent institutional context, exerting pressure on the incumbent utility to adopt and diffuse wind technology. These findings from our case study are consistent with our framework′s assumption, indicating that the large-scale diffusion of new technologies through incumbent firms requires an institutional change process of the field and that environmental groups are able to bring about such change. However, this change process is slow and intense, and it requires substantial resources, expertise, and dedication to convince relevant constituents that the new technology is worthy of support.

Our theoretical framework also suggests that environmental groups can directly approach incumbent firms to introduce new practices instead of trying to undermine or displace them. We find that environmental groups did not only approach the incumbent utility and introduce the idea of utility-scale wind power generation, but provided, in a more collaborative fashion, assistance to the incumbent utilities. Indeed, they considered them “as important allies” (Hirst, 1994, p. 71) in order to achieve a large-scale diffusion of wind technology in Colorado. Our results indicate that environmental groups had the professional skills to offer assistance to the electric utility in the process of new technology adoption. These findings are in contrast with previous studies on social movements′ tactics which mainly emphasize protest and confrontational actions designed to disrupt the field and their unwillingness to compromise (e.g., Brulle, 2000, Carmin, 1999, King and Pearce, 2010). Our findings reveal, rather, that environmental groups can provide hands-on technical assistance (Fischhoff, 2007) to help utilities adopt new technologies, providing them with the opportunity to gain experience with very low risks (Bird et al., 2005), and thus encourage utilities to adopt and diffuse the new, unknown technology. In addition, our case study illustrates that the utility suffered from a poor environmental reputation because of its reliance on coal. This finding is consistent with prior research suggesting that the more the portfolio of utilities is based on coal, the more they lack the credibility among consumers to successfully implement green offerings (Delmas et al., 2007). However, the partnership with the environmental groups seemed to provide the electric utility with the necessary credibility to successfully commercialize the new technology. Thus, we extend our theoretical framework and propose that environmental groups, by assisting incumbents, support them in overcoming barriers and risks of new technology adoption and diffusion, and serve as a bridge to increased credibility.",Energy Policy,,
Combining feed-in tariffs and net-metering schemes to balance development in adoption of photovoltaic energy: Comparative economic assessment and policy implications for European countries,"In the last fifteen years, Europe has been involved in the major development of photovoltaic (PV) solar energy. The Kyoto Protocol requirements and the European Union (EU) directives to promote the use of renewable energy sources (RES) together with environmental policies introduced for the development and use of alternative energies have generated a large number of market opportunities for this sector. Differences in the application of energy policies have caused significant imbalances in electricity systems and distortion of electricity prices. The main concern of governments is to define the support schemes to be used and how to combine them in the most profitable manner. The aim of this paper is to provide a comparative cost- effectiveness assessment using feed-in tariffs (FiT) and net-metering (NM) schemes in some representative EU countries. The authors have developed an economic model to evaluate the profitability of PV projects combining these support schemes. Results show not only the circumstances under which solar energy is economically profitable, but also the kind of PV systems, locations, minimum levels of tariff prices and specific combination of support schemes that should be promoted. his paper has presented a model for comparative cost-effective- ness assessment of PV systems with different combinations of feed-in tariff (FiT) and net-metering (NM) schemes. The model takes into consideration all the factors that could affect the profitability of a PV power plant, such as legal, financial, economical, technological and geographical factors. Feed-in tariff and net-metering schemes are mixed to different degrees in order to evaluate the best combination of these mechanisms to produce a profitable plant. The model has been used to perform a comparative analysis of the profitability in the seven countries with the largest PV installed capacity in Europe. Over the last fifteen years, these countries have produced 85.7% of the total PV installed capacity share. The main conclusions and policy implications from the present work are summarised below.
First, a combination of feed-in tariffs with net-metering schemes is a viable option for PV development in most of the countries considered using the PV systems studied and adopting suitable levels of tariff prices. The work offers a complete analysis of the alternatives that could be economically profitable in each country and within a feasible level of FiT prices. Second, the results show that this renewable energy generation system is not profitable in most cases without the support of an electricity compensation scheme. The results are favourable only once the FiT price rate achieves a greater level than the electricity costs. It is for this reason that a full net-metering or self-consumption scheme will be feasible only once upfront costs are low enough to make PV energy economically profitable or when electricity prices are high enough to balance these costs.
Third, plant size seems to be a key factor with a significant impact on profitability owing to the considerable decrease in upfront costs with plant dimensions. The results provide evidence supporting the fact that larger solar plants are more profitable than medium and small systems.
Fourth, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece seem to be the most attractive countries to invest in PV projects mainly due to favourable financial conditions in Germany and the excellent solar irradiation levels in Italy, Spain and Greece. Moreover, high electricity prices, mainly in Spain and Italy, tend to favour this type of combined schemes. In these countries, the net-metering or self-consumption schemes should prove attractive to potential consumers. Spain may activate its self-consumption law for the benefit of “prosumers”. In contrast, the UK and Belgium show the weakest economic profitability results. PV development in these countries seems to have been mainly promoted by the high level of compensation provided by the govern- ment. In the case of France, the results are more favourable for large plants than for medium and small units, which seem to be unprofitable.
Fifth, concerning the upfront costs of PV power plants, the results support the fact that the initial investment is still too high to allow PV energy to be economical without additional support. Actions should be implemented to reduce upfront costs by using new materials or new technologies.
The work presented in this paper may help the authorities in the countries analysed to make efficient decisions concerning where, how and under what conditions PV policies should be promoted. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of the main variables discussed in this paper could help to guide future decisions.
Further work could focus on a comparative analysis taking into consideration other technological parameters such as the PV module type. An assessment of other geographical areas and the extension of
the model to enable the evaluation of other types of RES projects, such as wind energy, might also be conducted.",Energy Policy,,
Consumer Stock Ownership Plans (CSOPs)—The Prototype Business Model for Renewable Energy Communities,"The 2018 recast of the Renewable Energy Directive (D II) defines “renewable energy communities” (Cs), introducing a new governance model and the possibility of energy sharing for them. It has to be transposed into national law by all European Union Member States until June 2021. This article introduces consumer stock ownership plans (CSOPs) as the prototype business model for Cs. Based on the analysis of a dataset of 67 best-practice cases of consumer (co-) ownership from 18 countries it demonstrates the importance of flexibility of business models to include heterogeneous co-investors for meeting the requirements of the D II and that of  clusters. It is shown that CSOPs—designed to facilitate scalable investments in utilities—facilitate co-investments by municipalities, SMEs, plant engineers or energy suppliers. A low-threshold financing method, they enable individuals, in particular low-income households, to invest in renewable projects. Employing one bank loan instead of many micro loans, CSOPs reduce transaction costs and enable consumers to acquire productive capital, providing them with an additional source of income. Stressing the importance of a holistic approach including the governance and the technical side for the acceptance of Cs on the energy markets recommendations for the transposition are formulated.",energies,,
"Creating Synergies from Renewable Energy Investments, a Community Success Story from Lolland, Denmark","The island of Lolland is a showcase example of a remote local community being able to stand up to the challenges of facing environmental and social consequences of climate change while creating economic opportunities. This island has had many years of experience in implementing renewable energy projects as a way to combating peripheral poverty and promoting economic growth in a relatively remote area. The development strategy lies within the unique concept of Lolland Community Testing Facilities (community testing facilities), which creates a forum between the private sector, research institutions and local political authorities by exploiting synergies among green investments and providing an international testing and demonstration platform for renewable energy technology and products. The present paper aims at giving an overview of integrated longer term energy planning based on Lolland community testing facilities, its components and main features, while highlighting those critical characteristics that could make the community testing facilities model successful and relevant for -based local development worldwide. Lolland is working towards the creation of a sustainable future, focussing on green energy and closely targeting the needs and opportunities of its natural, social and economic context. By using its own natural resources and potentials, Lolland has developed a comprehensive list of initiatives -under the Community Testing Facility umbrella- promoting effective technologies in the environment and energy sectors. All of these have been contributing to the sustainable development of a remote area and the targeted tackling of climatic challenges.
Lolland is already recognized “bottom-up-based best practice”. The Municipality has wind turbines at sea and on land; centralised heating plants based on woodchips and hay; Denmark’s first hydrogen community based on wind power and much more. The Municipality actively involves existing industries, the region’s farmers and inhabitants in a shared greener future. Thanks to Lolland Municipality’s approach, implemented in concrete terms via dynamic synergies among public, private and academia stakeholders, the island has been able to regenerate its socio-economic context and preserve the quality of the environment. It has therefore positioned itself as a good example of a remote and peripheral community (within an interconnected power grid) taking up the development challenge in a proactive and sustainable way.
This paper proposes to analyse the strategy implemented by Lolland Municipality and its strategic partner Bass, as well as its replicability, in light of the local context, which results from the interaction of social, economic and environmental factors that are characterized by feedbacks, delays and nonlinearity. Under this stream of research, the following critical variables have been identified: community involvement, political support, targeted funding, advanced and rational planning of local areas, strong strategic partnerships.
All these aspects have contributed to the flourishing of renewable energy on the island via the Lolland community testing facilities model. By taking these variables in consideration and adapting them into their local context, other communities could potentially profit from the experience of Lolland as a source of inspiration in defining longer-term strategies that account for renewable energy and climate-sound investments, while creating opportunities for local and international businesses.",energies,,
Critical Success Factors for integrating renewable energy development in a country with 2 systems: The case of Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong SAR in China,"China is well ahead in the renewable energy (RE) sector, both for its manufacturing and installation capabilities, although grid connection is lacking behind. Whilst most generating sites are in the northeastern and northwestern provinces due to geography, the south has a role to play. Zooming down the Pearl River Delta (PRD), with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region at its estuary, complementary effects on RE have been taking place due to “One Country – Two Systems” since 1997, when the latter's sovereignty was reverted to China. A study was carried out on the challenges facing the RE sector in the PRD, its Critical Success Factors and collaborative opportunities. Quantitative survey findings indicate keen competition, grid connection and skilled labour shortage problems. Critical Success Factors include the availability of capital and grid connection incentives, customers’ satisfaction, R & D capability, grid stability, safety and competitiveness with fossil power. Qualitative interviews confirm Hong Kong's edge as a market economy having a trusted legal environment, since it can attract mainland RE enterprises in public listing, financing, exhibiting, providing insurance services and a platform for intellectual property protection and trading, both for their domestic and overseas ventures. Maintenance of status quo (i.e., stability) is important. Earlier works by Battaglini et al. (2009) expounded on the broad issues surrounding RE integration for the SuperSmart Grid bridging continents, and Chang and Li (2015) calls for institutional and systematic solutions to RE barriers with regional collaboration in the ASEAN electricity market. This study extends their works by identifying similar challenges but more specific barriers facing the RE sector in the PRD, in which Hong Kong SAR is situated. Keen competition, grid connection and skilled labour shortage problems top the list. Since the 2 places belong to the same country China but have different political and economic systems, there are existing and potential complementary effects in the generation and use of RE, which may benefit both places. Hong Kong, as a window to the mainland with worldwide connections, a hitherto trusted legal environment and a laissez-faire economic policy (which, unlike a planned economy, is not easily subject to administrative maneuvering), is endowed with an efficient and deep-pocketed financial market with global players. As for the identified challenges and barriers, the study finds out that Hong Kong may help in providing or assembling the needed capital for the RE sector in the PRD to expand both locally and overseas. Part of the grid connection bottleneck may be relieved by additional capital investment for the needed infrastructure, although the resistance of local grid entities to allow RE connection is another matter needing attention of the mainland authority, which is being stepped up. For the skilled labour shortage, Hong Kong may help by its education and training programmes in engineering, business and marketing, which have already attracted a lot of mainland students.

Apart from sufficiency of capital, the Critical Success Factors identified in this study include the need to meet quality requirements of customers, building up of technology and R & D capabilities, as well as reaching parity of competition with conventional power. Hong Kong may not be able to offer too much in the latter two factors (although R & D is catching up with efforts by the Science & Technology Park, the newly established Innovation & Technology Bureau, etc.), quality assurance is a strength of Hong Kong, through its accredited testing facilities and talent, meeting world standards with trust.

Areas of potential collaboration have also been identified, including capital market listing of mainland RE entities, joint ventures, promotion/exhibition for overseas market expansion, insurance services and intellectual property protection as well as rights-trading. These collaborative areas are worth nurturing and strengthening.

Despite the specificity of barriers facing PRD and Hong Kong SAR, they illustrate important aspects of investment, financial/technological/policy uncertainties, transmission constraints and import dependency, which pertain even to broader collaboration/integration efforts. However, before one can generalize the findings of this study which are limited by the small sample size, the complementary effects of collaboration must be fostered with caveats in mind. Market fluctuations, such as those leading to transitional disturbances in the pricing of PV cells and thin films, can be ridden over with endurance of little pain. However, for longer term sustainability in the context of the region discussed, the “One country – Two systems” promise must be genuinely implemented to instill a true spirit of cooperation. Hongkongers need to ensure political stability and observance of law and order, so as to maintain its competitive edge. After all, a long-lasting integration of the RE market and, in a more important sense, economic success and environmental well-being in the region, depend on mutual recognition of the Critical Success Factors and the conditions conducive to their achievement. Future research is also needed on how current dilemma arising from conflicts between sustainability, desirable self-sufficiency, reliability and tariff level can be resolved.",Energy Policy,,
CUBA'S ENERGY REVOLUTION AND 2030 POLICY GOALS: MORE PENETRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN ELECTRICITY GENERATION.,"Cuba has been remarkably successful at revitalising its energy sector over the last two decades, significantly increasing efficiency and reducing energy intensity and emissions. This article analyses those successes and looks at the policy challenges ahead for Cuba to achieve its 2030 energy policy goals. We argue the nascent success of the 2006 Energy Revolution is due to its comprehensive approach, targeting infrastructure, consumption habits and people's understanding of energy issues. We then examine some of Cuba's current energy challenges, presenting data on Cuba's energy mix as of 2014. We analyse the country's proposed energy policy to achieve 24% penetration of renewable energies in electricity generation by 2030. The Cuban government has an array of policy tools, from stimulating domestic production to changing foreign investment regulations, in order to achieve its goals. One of the most significant recent policy shifts includes the External Investment Law, which creates a regulatory framework and policies, including ones to utilise and develop perspectives of renewable sources of energy that will help to expedite the path toward a diverse energy mix with a large presence of renewables.  The Energy Revolution launched in Cuba in 2006 was a clear indication that the thinking of the government and experts of the island agree with Kurt Yeager, former President of the Electric Power Research Institute when he said, ‘The current power infrastructure is as incompatible with the future as horse trails were to automobiles’ (Greenpeace 2005: 2). The use of kerosene for cooking, incandescent bulbs lighting technology and centralised production of electricity are
totally incompatible with a sustainable energy future. Although there is still plenty of room for energy transformations and efficiency in all sectors of the
Cuban economy and particularly in transportation, Cuba is heading in the right direction. The Energy Revolution has been quite successful in addressing the country’s energy challenges. It was a broad-based, comprehensive programme that educated the population, introduced efficient appliances and lighting, and decentralised power generation. Recent government initiatives to increase the amount of renewable energy sources for electricity production, although still leaving the country very dependent on fossil fuels, address some of Cuba’s energy problems and pave the way to a sustainable energy future.",International Journal of Cuban Studies,,
Determinants of renewable and non-renewable energy demand in China ,"The present study is designed to empirically investigate the effect of financial development, per capita income and trade openness on renewable and non-renewable energy consumption in China. To achieve that, we make use of annual data from 1980 to 2016 and employ several robust time series econometric techniques. Our empirical findings from the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) technique suggest that increase financial development and per capita income contribute for higher energy demand of both renewable and non-renewable energy sources in China. The evidences also show that their impact is more on renewable energy than that of non-renewable energy. These findings indicate that both financial development and per capita income are the important factors in driving renewable energy consumption in China. In contradiction to that, the trade openness positively affects non-renewable energy consumption, while it negatively impacts on renewable energy. This therefore infers that the internationalization of trade is putting more pressure on non-renewable energy sources in China. Given these findings, we discuss and provide numerous practical and policy implications for China. This study is designed to empirically examine the effect of financial development, per capita income and trade openness on renewable and non-renewable energy demand in China. To achieve this objective, we made use of annual data from 1980 to 2016 and applied robust time series econometric techniques. Our results established that financial development has a considerable positive impact on energy demand. This finding can be attributed to the fact that the growth of financial sector development helps firms and entrepreneurs to acquire capital with lower cost. Therefore, better financed firms and entrepreneurs demand more energy. Likewise, the results of our study show that the growth in per capita income played an important role in increasing both renewable and non-renewable energy demand in China. This implies that higher levels of individuals’ income create more demand for electronic goods which in turn consume higher level of energy. Moreover, it is also important to highlight that both financial development and income growth, have considerable higher effect on demand for renewable energy than for non-renewable energy. Trade openness is shown to be driving only non-renewable energy uses in China. It means that higher level of exports and imports of China is putting more pressure on fossil energy sources. As a major trade partner of the world market, China currently accounts for more than one-fourth of the global CO2 emissions.

Given these empirical findings, we discuss relevant practical and policy implications for China. The evidence showed that financial development has a more positive impact on renewable energy uses is particularly relevant for policy discussion. Precisely, this suggests that the financial development ensures sustainable economic development in China by providing more funds for the renewable energy projects and also promoting demand for renewable energy. In this way, the development of financial sector is expected to help China with the development of a sustainable and environment-friendly growth pattern. The policy makers and practitioners of China should realize the importance of renewable energy in their total energy mix and divert significant amount of funds into renewable energy projects. In such a way, the share of renewable energy in total energy mix can significantly increase, and meet the increasing demand for energy by all sectors of the country. As a result, China will not only meet increasing energy demand but also achieve lower level of CO2 emissions. The policy makers also should provide tax incentives for the renewable energy firms, which will therefore further motivate the firms to invest more on these projects. Consequently, China will be able to achieve targeted growth rates and meanwhile develop a sustainable economic growth pattern in the country.

In addition to the above policy recommendations, this study also adds an important value to the empirical literature by identifying the potential drivers of renewable and non-renewable energy sources in one of the major emerging economies. Further, our study adds an additional value to the body of knowledge by providing recent evidences on the factors that promote renewable energy. Finally, our study uses a comprehensive financial development index, which takes into account of both financial institutions (banks) and stock markets. Therefore, the findings of financial development on energy indicators are more reliable. Given all of that our study makes significant contribution to the energy literature, particularly in the context of China. The main limitation of this study is that we investigated the determinants of renewable and non-renewable energy at the national level. Therefore, the future study may investigate the determinants of these energy sources at the regional and provincial levels in China, once data becomes available.",Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,,
Devising renewable heat policy: Overview of support options ,"Renewable energy sources of heat offer the substantial economic, environmental and social benefits associated with renewable electricity but policy to support their expansion is considerably less advanced. The potential for applying various support instruments to renewable heat is considered with advantages and disadvantages discussed.

Highlights
► A range of policy options can support deployment of renewable heat technologies. ► Effective renwable energyS-H policy must consider wider regulation and planning issues. ► Effective renwable energyS-H policy must consider the relative maturity of technologies. Getting renewable energy policy right is not an easy task. Effective policy must consider many factors, addressing multiple barriers and requiring different instruments to be applied simultaneously whilst avoiding overspending and conflicts with multiple stakeholders and maintaining political support. There is a need to be able to identify and satisfy the particular support needs of disparate technologies and preferably to get it right first time to avoid financial and political costs. Attention must be paid as to when one instrument should give way to another and when a technology should be abandoned.

Designing support for renwable energyS-H needs to be firmly rooted in the lessons learned from renwable energyS-E policy – learning them over again would ignore one fundamental lesson, minimisation of costs – but must note the limits of those lessons and the added complexity that stems from the different operating conditions of the renwable energyS-H technologies and the different nature of supply and demand for heat energy.

Addressing the need for more sustainable sources of heat will have to become a major component of renewable energy policy if nations are to achieve long term targets for CO2 emission reduction and if innovation and deployment are to be adequately stimulated. Perhaps the overarching lesson of the renwable energyS-E policy experience is the need to develop a holistic policy environment, addressing all elements of policy in order to be effective. The different levels of technological and commercial maturity represented by the renwable energyS-H technologies will require different policy instruments if they are to progress to commerciality. These policies will need to provide both appropriately targeted financial support to create opportunity for demonstration and increasing demand for technologies, whilst applying other instruments to assist in overcoming barriers to penetration of technologies. Action to expand stakeholder awareness and engagement must be leavened with practical assistance to expand the base of trained personnel capable and willing to deliver systems to consumers. Experience in Upper Austria, a region which is among the most advanced in developing renwable energyS-H Policy and deploying renwable energyS-H technology is that making the process as easy and painless as possible more easily attract consumers to engage with the technology (Egger et al., 2009).

Some policy instruments may prove to be more apt for application in some places than others and it is important to emphasise that no single set of policy instruments is likely to deliver a holistic solution everywhere. It is important however that all states have a clear view of what they are trying to achieve with their respective renewable energy policy strategies, to take into account the advantages and disadvantages of different instruments and to draw conclusions as to the most appropriate based on comparative assessment and on practical experience with the application of policy instruments.

It seems likely that the EU will be the focal point for much in the way of initial efforts in applying renwable energyS-H policy, since action is already legally mandated by the 2009 Renewables Directive. It should be noted that China is by some margin the global leader in both production and installation of solar thermal but that this is not the result of a specific policy. This EU focus seems likely to mean that as regards renwable energyS-H that there should be less of a place for any repetition of the debate as to the relative merits of quota and tariff mechanisms, as has been the case with renwable energyS-E policy. Many of the arguments for quota instruments are less apparent for renwable energyS-H and with the steady undermining of the economic case for quota mechanisms as a result of the evidence in their application to renwable energyS-E the case for applying subsidy through some form of tariff mechanism seems to be indicated. However, it is also apparent that a number of states appear to favour some form of regulation, most notably in the form of a Use Obligation on individual developers. It is perhaps here that there is potential for an instrument to compete with tariffs as a driver for growth in renwable energyS-H, though this is unlikely to be desirable and the sooner that conclusions can be drawn as to their relative merits in practice the better off both nations and taxpayers are likely to be.",Energy Policy,,
Diverse interpretations enabling the continuity of community renewable energy projects: A case study of a woody biomass project in rural area of Japan,"Community renewable energy projects have captured significant attention due to their potential to tackle climate change by socially and economically empowering local societies. Recently, however, various difficulties in the continuity of such projects over extended periods of time have been reported. As a case study, this article explores a woody biomass project, planned and put into practice by local people, which has lasted for over 10 years. The article first examines the process of collective decision-making among members who have diverse motivations. It then focuses on how the project objectives have been interpreted by individual members, paying particular attention to each member’s practice. The article shows that decisions related to the project were based on the diverse and constant social interactions between members, which focused on their collaboration rather than overall quantitative goals. I argue, both theoretically and empirically, that this vagueness of the overall goals has enabled the project’s continuity. Based on their own practices, it has allowed each project member to interpret the project and to gain a sense of its success. Diversity of practices within a project leads to plural sets of values, which bring sustainability to a project running in an uncertain context. This article took a woody biomass project in a rural part of Japan as a case study and elaborated on the factors which have enabled the project’s continuity. I looked at the process of decision-making by individuals who have their own motivations and interests in the project. I then focused on individuals’ practices within the project and how they perceived the project. First, the findings suggest that the project has been run based on decision-making which involved diverse, constant social interactions. This has enabled the members to situate the project in the local context (cf. Catney et al., 2013; Miyauchi, 2017). Second, I suggest that the fact that the project does not have a clear overall goal has enabled each member to understand the project’s success based on their own practices, and there are therefore various sets of values coexisting within the project. Following Miyauchi (2013), these plural sets of values, I argue, have enabled the project to continue over time in spite of negative developments.

This article has contributed to the literature on Community Renewable Energy projects by providing an in-depth qualitative case study which has focused on the continuity of a project and the social dynamics it entails. Furthermore, I have introduced a Japanese case study and literature which will enrich the existing debates in the field.",Local Economy,,
"Drivers, Barriers, and Success Factors for Improving Energy Management in the Pulp and Paper Industry","Successful energy management is a way to achieve energy efficiency in the pulp and paper industry (PPI), which is important for assuring energy supply security, for increasing economic competitiveness, and for mitigating greenhouse gases. However, research shows that although energy use within PPI can be reduced by 5.5–19.4% per year, some of this by energy management practices, energy management is not always implemented. Why is this so? What are the barriers to, and drivers of implementation? How can the barriers be overcome? A systematic review of barriers and drivers in energy management in the PPI within peer-reviewed scientific articles suggests that the world-wide events that affect energy supply, volatility, and use seemingly also affect the number and frequency of research articles on energy management in the PPI. The perception of energy management in the PPI seems to be dominated by the understanding that it can mostly be achieved through technological improvements aiming to improve energy efficiency. The main driver of energy management was shown to be economic conditions: high and unstable energy prices, followed by drivers such as the need to remain internationally competitive, collaboration and energy management systems. Meanwhile, examples of the most important barriers are technical risks, lack of access to capital, lack of time and other priorities, and slim organization. The success factors for enhancing drivers and overcoming barriers were continuous energy accounting, energy-related collaboration, energy-efficiency programmes, and benchmarking. Altogether, success factors for energy management for improved energy efficiency could be summarized in the 4M framework—the “4M for energy efficiency”: mind, measure, monitor, and manage—that could be used as the energy management memory-tool that could lead to improved energy efficiency in other sectors as well. This systematic review showed that like many manufacturing industries, the PPI has the potential to become more sustainable, more robust in the face of sudden and unexpected energy-market variations and shortages, more diversified, more profitable, and more resilient to international competition, and that EnM is an important means to achieve these goals.
The descriptive analysis conducted within the systematic review indicated that world-wide events affecting energy supply, volatility, and usage seemingly also affected the number and frequency of research articles on EnM within the PPI.
This systematic review has revealed the dominance of the perception that EnM consists of the improvement of EE via technological innovations. Research is dominated by studies addressing implementation/operation and controlling, mainly from a technical perspective, whereas research addressing organization and culture was absent. Similarly, research articles addressing “internal audits of the EnMS”, and “Management”—areas within ISO 50001—were also absent. This indicates research areas still to be addressed.
Research primarily addressing barriers to and drivers of EnM within the PPI, that is, research focusing on reasons for implementing and conducting EnM, was absent. Barriers and drivers were addressed in some studies without being the main focus and this revealed that economic factors, such as high and unstable energy prices, dominated compared to environmental concerns, hence, the main driver was the perceived need to reduce energy costs by increasing EE. Additionally, important drivers were shown to be governmental intervention via policies and regulations, for example, the EU ETS, which increased general awareness of other energy-related issues and non-energy benefits, for example, enhanced production rates. The barriers that were addressed within the reviewed scientific articles were technical risks, lack of access to capital, inappropriateness at the mill, lack of time and other priorities, slim organization, large investments that need to be justified over the long-term, and established companies possessing political power. Again, this suggests another research area remaining to be tackled.
Similarly, research primarily addressing success factors for overcoming the barriers and encouraging the drivers for EnM within the PPI was absent. Nevertheless, success factors could be selected from research studies focusing primarily on other issues. Successful implementation and maintenance of continuous EnM, continuous energy accounting, energy-related collaboration, a holistic approach, energy-efficiency programmes, benchmarking, market-related public policy instruments for overcoming market-related barriers, and firm-internal EnM for overcoming firm-related barriers were the success factors that were addressed. Once again, this is another research area that needs to be explored.
The results demonstrated the importance of continuous EnM and a holistic understanding not only of the direct and indirect effects that a change in energy use might have, but also of the interactions between different policies and the impacts of those policies, the urgency of the problem to be solved, and cooperation between industry and government. Hence, this systematic review suggested that to overcome the challenge of achieving a sustainable and profitable PPI, there is a need for research that focuses on identifying and defining both the barriers to and drivers of EnM in the PPI and the means for overcoming the barriers and encouraging the drivers, based on a holistic understanding of EnM in this industry.
This study showed that the most important inter-related aspects of EnM for improving EE could be summarized by the 4M EnM memory-tool, that is, “4M for improving energy efficiency”: mind, measure, monitor, and manage (Figure 11). The 4M EnM memory-tool is intended to be a complement to the EnM systems and would be associated primarily with EnM for improving EE and emphasise the importance of practicing all the four Ms together. This study also demonstrated that the 4M EnM memory-tool could be used for identifying whether all the parts of EnMS are addressed, which in turn could lead to eventually decreasing the EE gap. The main success factors seem to be the continuous management of energy issues, collaboration, and a holistic approach, as shown by [60]. Indeed, this study showed that a change in EnM can trigger several events, leading not only to EE but also to non-energy benefits that together lead towards sustainability. For illustration, the need to find an alternative energy source for oil increased interest in domestic energy sources, for example, wood incineration. This generated a fear that the actual accessible quantities of wood for fuel could be over-used, which in turn could outcompete the cheap access to wood for use in pulp and paper manufacturing. However, the consequence of such a fear turned out to be the generation of positive results. Specifically, the use of recycled paper in PPI has increased. And this in turn not only reduced the need for wood as a raw material but also decreased energy use, since the energy required for producing pulp from recycled paper is only ~20% of that needed to make mechanical pulp from virgin wood [60]. Furthermore, the usage of previous by-products from the pulp manufacturing process became a solution to the previous waste disposal problem, which together led to the improvements of EE and reduction of energy use, further decreasing CO2 emissions [60]. Concerning the importance of a holistic approach and understanding, the results showed that by affecting one factor, such as the need to find an alternative energy source, one can trigger a complex process that was not intended from the start. For example, it was not only the known relationships that were affected, such as the relationship between the need to find an alternative energy source and the disposal of waste (e.g., newspaper and bark), but also emissions (e.g., CO2, elemental chlorine and organic substances). Indeed, the Swedish example shows that, by phasing out oil, the PPI had reduced its CO2 emissions considerably, prior to concerns about climate change being discussed internationally. Furthermore, the Swedish example shows the importance of government intervention. Indeed, much of the basic knowledge that was used for improving EE and using more sustainable energy carriers was known before the oil crises because of the stable and low prices for oil. For example, the possibility of burning internal organic residual products through back-pressure turbine for power generation was known. This shows that the driving forces towards sustainability can be need and price.
The literature review acknowledged a scarcity of papers in the area of ESCOs and energy services, while for other sectors energy services has been shown to be deployed. If this is due to a real lack or just a scarcity of studies is difficult to state. As stated by Thollander and Ottosson [42], energy services in the PPI are more likely to be more attractive in activities that are outside of the core production process, and where the lower the energy integration is in relation to the production processes, as it may take 5–10 years to gain sufficient knowledge of the production to deploying EE. A general conclusion, based on this, may be that different explanatory models exist between different sectors, even regarding the organizational issues. For example, a Swedish pulp mill, normally using 1–3% of Sweden’s total industrial energy use, demands a very thorough understanding of the energy using processes and waste heat flows, before even considering making a change. Meanwhile, a large automobile manufacturer, using less than 0.1% of the Swedish industrial energy use, can rely more heavily on procurement practices, procuring the most efficient new technologies, and also being able to utilize energy service companies to a higher extent. In comparison, a study among European foundries showed deployment levels of energy services in about one fourth of the studies foundries [43].
The comparison revealed that the “manage” aspect of EnM systems was not being addressed, when addressing EnM in PPI. Nevertheless, according to [21], “EnM comprises the systematic activities, procedures and routines within an industrial company including the elements strategy/planning, implementation/operation, controlling, organization and culture and involving both production and support processes, which aim to continuously reduce the company’s energy consumption and its related energy costs”. Meaning that according to Schulze et al. [21], the human dimension is an important part of the EnM. This is in agreement with other studies; for example, Caffal [25] claimed that EnM is all about managing and encouraging people to use energy more efficiently. Jovanovic et al. [84] also emphasized the importance of the human dimension in EnM: “An EnM system cannot be implemented if there is no leadership. Without the support of top management, employees will not take part”. This, from research studies addressing EnM practices, suggests that “manage” could be a success factor leading to the decrease in the EE gap in the PPI.",Sustainability,,
Energy transition in Germany and regional spill-overs: The diffusion of renewable energy in firms,"The success of transitioning energy consumption towards renewables highly depends on the willingness and ability of firms to adopt energy technologies that use renewable sources. Existing studies focus on the role of regulation and energy markets to explaining the diffusion of green energy. This paper looks at the specific role of the firms' regional environment in this process. We use a unique database combining the Community Innovation Survey 2014 for Germany and district-level data on renewable energy plants, the attitudes of a region's population towards 'green issues' and other control variables. We find that geographical proximity to electricity production based on renewable energy sources and the orientation of a region towards 'green issues' are both correlated to such innovations. Therefore, not only ""hard"" regulation measures such as the renewable energy law are relevant for renewable energy innovations. Our results show that subsidies for eco-innovation, high energy costs and regional knowledge spill-overs are linked to a rapid adoption of renewable energy by firms. The ongoing energy transition in Germany aims at substituting the majority of fossil energy sources by renewables for the production of electricity. The existing literature stresses the role of regulation activities and an adequate policy mix of technology push and demand pull measures as main drivers of the diffusion of renewable energy. Despite the fact that most of the relevant political measures in Germany such as the renewable energy law are nation-wide, the distribution of renewable energy innovation activities varies considerably among regions. The present paper tries to identify some factors that are linked to these regional disparities. Our econometric analysis is based on a unique combination of different databases: The main source is firm level data from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 2014 for Germany which contains information on eco-innovation activities, including innovations in renewable energy. This database has been merged with data on renewable energy plants (solar, biomass, gas, water and wind) in a firm's region and with data on green attitudes of the regional population, using the share of votes for the Green Party. Both regional variables are measured for the time prior to the period for which data on eco-innovation activities have been collected.

The results of our econometric analysis show that both the existing capacity for renewable energy production in a region based on solar and biomass, and the share of green voters are positively linked to subsequent renewable energy innovation in firms. Though the time structure of our data may suggest a causal link between the regional environment and a firm's innovations in renewables, we refrain from interpreting our results in such a way. Since we only have cross-section data on firm innovation, we cannot exclude that unobserved prior eco-innovations of firms influenced the existing capacity for renewable energy production in a region.

Having said that, our results point to spill-overs within a region that drive the diffusion of renewable energy innovations. There seems to be a demonstration and learning effect from existing regional capacities in renewables for firms that want to substitute fossil energy sources by renewable ones. In addition, firms that operate in a region with a high share of ecologically sensitive people tend to receive more impulses to engage in renewable energy innovations.

Restricting our analysis to eco-innovators helps to detect specificities of renewable energy innovations compared to other eco-innovation fields. The results show that present regulations and taxes are less relevant for renewables compared to other eco-innovations whereas the firms perceive a positive influence of expected future regulations on their renewable energy innovations. Improving the reputation of the firm is more relevant for renewable energy innovations compared to other eco-innovations. Rising energy costs seem to be a main motive to introduce renewables.

All in all, our analysis shows that there is a positive link between renewable energy innovations in firms on the one hand, and the prior presence of renewable energy production plants and the environmental awareness of a region's population on the other hand. Both regional factors can reinforce the diffusion of renewables in a region and hence strengthen a path dependency. For energy policy, our results suggest that in addition to ""hard"" regulation measures such as the renewable energy law and the European emission trading system, soft instruments may also play a role in accelerating the diffusion of renewable energy technologies. Though the link is not necessarily a causal one, strengthening soft policy instruments such as measures to encourage social and environmental responsibility of managers or environmental awareness of the population can reinforce renewable energy diffusion in firms.",Energy Policy,,
"Energy transitions, sub-national government and regime flexibility: How has devolution in the United Kingdom affected renewable energy development?","Amidst growing analytical interest in the spatial dimensions of sustainable energy transitions, relatively little attention has been given to the role of sub-national government, or the ways in which dominant socio-technical regimes for energy navigate diverse contexts. This paper addresses these two concerns by assessing the impacts of devolution within the UK on renewable energy development. It draws principally on policy networks analysis as the basis of a comparative assessment, examining how far the governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have translated their formal powers in the energy sphere into renewable energy outcomes. Scotland’s relative success in facilitating rapid expansion of on-shore wind is attributed to a more enduring and cohesive policy community around renewable energy growth than in Northern Ireland and Wales, but this success has been adversely affected by fragmenting policy networks around renewables at national (UK) level. The analysis highlights especially the role of planning and consenting, as mechanisms by which devolved governments have worked to contain the potentially disruptive effects of opposition to major infrastructure investments, thereby enhancing regime reproduction. Our analysis has shown how the actions of sub-national government can shape wider dynamics of energy transition. Within the UK, the devolved governments have not been passive recipients of renewable energy investment in their territories, but have sought to encourage its development using the powers available to them. This is clearest in Scotland, but both the Northern Ireland Executive and Welsh Government have also sought to steer development, adopting policy approaches that depart from Westminster norms. The analysis also offers useful wider insights into the spatial constitution of energy transitions. It shows how ‘national’ transitions are constituted by actions at other governmental levels. More fundamentally, our research shows how focusing on sub-national government can reveal wider causal processes in energy transitions, beyond the dynamics of technological innovation. With electricity generation in the UK, it has been the steering of deployment of existing technologies (notably on-shore wind) in which sub-national government has had greatest effect on renewable energy capacity to date, notably in the way that planning processes have been used to orchestrate the delivery of new generation facilities.

Policy network analysis has aided explanation of renewable energy outcomes and the renewable energy case shows how network form can matter. Scottish Governments have forged a sustained coherent policy community around renewable energy expansion, that is relatively territorially rooted in Scotland, and this helps explain why Scotland has seen a higher level of development than Northern Ireland (or England in some respects) despite having fewer formal powers at their disposal. Indeed, only for Scotland were interviewees clear that devolution per se had made a difference to renewable energy outcomes, based on its territorial alliance-forming potential:
‘It’s allowed us to have that debate here, and to have that focus and talk about sustainable economic development … every community, every sector in Scotland can align and play that role, so I think that’s been utterly fundamental’ (ScotGov4).


The predominance of issues networks explains why Northern Ireland, England and Wales have, at various times (and for particular technologies) not matched Scotland’s achievements. The policy community in Scotland generates power in actu, in that it galvanises and is galvanised by the use of the available governance powers in an assertive manner, bringing diverse actors into alignment. That devolved governments remain dependent on how the UK government organises market support is also readily apparent, such that Scotland’s wind energy expansion ‘may have been facilitated by the [Scottish] planning system but it’s really been driven by the subsidy’ (ScotNGO1). In Northern Ireland we saw how constitutional-legal resources (to pursue their own forms of market support) were traded against the greater financial resources attained by maintaining interdependencies with the UK. Yet national state policy developments are also amenable to explanation through policy networks, notably the minimal influence of devolved governments on debates about market support as policy communities around renewable energy expansion in Westminster fragmented into a more volatile issues network.

However, while the effects of sub-national governments and policy networks on energy transitions has been demonstrated, the results are not easily converted into straightforward instrumental recommendations for institutional design, as our comparative analysis revealed. Although absolute levels of renewable energy development are lower in Northern Ireland (perhaps because it is the smallest territory), it has still achieved rapid expansion rates, especially of on-shore wind, and without such a coherent policy community. Relative absence of effective opposition, compared to other parts of the UK, has relevance here. This suggests that forging policy communities around energy development may matter more where there are potentially effective opposing actors (see also [75]), and this in turn, may be particularly relevant to certain combinations of technological pathways and contexts. Seen in this light, Scotland has best displayed the kind of actor networks conducive to facilitating renewable energy expansion based on the bulk provision of controversial technologies like on-shore wind, where sustained elite cohesion around policy and implementation is important for investment. The rolling out of decentralised electricity systems based on micro-renewables, in which the navigation of land use planning constraints may be less critical than the coordination of diverse local actors, may depend on different policy networks with a different set of roles for sub-national governments.

This returns us to wider questions about the spatial constitution and embeddedness of socio-technical regimes and the qualitatively different energy transition pathways that could be pursued. Our results suggest that although devolution in the UK may be seen as fostering energy transition in that it has enhanced the quantitative expansion of renewable energy capacity, sub-national government has still largely served to maintain dominant systems of energy provision based on large facilities supplying electricity into a centralised and organisationally unchanged grid. The UK case shows how sub-national action can facilitate the spatial adaptability and temporal persistence of dominant socio-technical regimes, especially in planning and consenting, where the three devolved governments pursued arrangements that created more facilitative ‘protected spaces’ for infrastructure expansion than was observable in England, which has benefited onshore wind particularly. One could conclude that devolution in the UK is an illustration of ‘stabilizing landscape trends’ ([23], 36) – i.e. a set of wider processes that helps to reproduce existing regimes, but does so by facilitating contextual adaptation. Perhaps one should not be surprised at this, given that devolution in the UK is itself part of ongoing statecraft designed very largely to manage tensions within this union state. It shows why analysts of energy transitions ought to give greater attention to the politics of state re-scaling [12], and recognise how this may serve agendas that maintain key elements of the status quo as well as offer opportunities for radical change.",Energy Research & Social Science,,
Establishing an agenda for social studies research in marine renewable energy,"To date, academic research relating to Marine Renewable Energy (marine renwable energy) has largely focused on resource assessment, technical viability and environmental impact. Experiences from onshore renewable energy tell us that social acceptability is equally critical to project success. However, the specific nature of the marine environment, patterns of resource distribution and governance means experiences from onshore may not be directly applicable to marine renwable energy and the marine environment. This paper sets out an agenda for social studies research linked to marine renwable energy, identifying key topics for future research: (i) economic impacts; (ii) wealth distribution and community benefits; (iii) communication and knowledge flow; (iv) consultation processes; (v) dealing with uncertainty; (vi) public attitudes; and (vii) planning processes. This agenda is based on the findings of the first workshop of ISSMER, an international research network of social scientists with interests in marine renewable energy. Importantly, this research agenda has been informed by the experiences of developers, regulators and community groups in Orkney. The Orkney archipelago, off the north coast of Scotland, is home to the most intense cluster of marine renwable energy research, development and deployment activity in the world today. This paper has advanced an agenda for social science research into marine renwable energy. In the workshop upon which it is based, a novel approach was adopted to give academic researchers the opportunity to learn directly from real-world experiences. Discussions took place at the cutting edge of research, development and deployment, involving those negotiating sea space and the communities experiencing marine renwable energy development.

Three substantive conclusions can be drawn from the workshop:
•
Commercial-scale marine renwable energy development has potential to have major impact upon established patterns of sea use, rights of access, and social and cultural value systems.

•
Current models of consultation are failing to engage communities, initiate debate, communicate options and proposals or stimulate feedback. There is a need to reconsider what counts as consultation.

•
Uncertainty (concerning the scale and timing of future development, the technologies involved, impacts and governance) pervades all debate, frustrating decision-making processes and related consultation.


The broader purpose of our work has been to develop areas for research which both respond to and reach beyond existing social science themes. While social science has long held an interest in societal and environmental change, research on marine renwable energy development has the potential to help re-think substantial questions in many of its fields. In economics and human geography, for example, issues of networking and scale in job creation and industrial clustering will be re-thought as marine renwable energy development happens in predominantly rural and remote locations. Those interested in social aspects of the creation and of knowledge (such as sociologists and anthropologists) may find diverse ways of knowing – and indeed ways of being uncertain – amongst marine renwable energy communities that challenge easy assumptions of ‘expert’ and ‘lay’ identities. Even amongst issues that are perhaps predictably important in our agenda (job creation, the allocation of sea space, community benefits), we reveal important nuances, such as the potential for strong regional variations in public attitudes. Coastal communities are by no means homogenous as a category and neither are they so internally, and it will be a task for social science disciplines to track both diverse forms of marine renwable energy development and diverse responses to it. Underlying all of these is the opportunity for social science involvement in marine renwable energy right from its early stages, in which social science can be not merely a post hoc evaluative tool – perhaps lamenting poor consultation processes or missed economic opportunities – but a partner from the start in securing positive development and giving a voice to all those involved and affected.

It is clear that understanding social interactions associated with marine renwable energy is vital to the successful assimilation of large scale commercial marine renwable energy development into the marine environment. As new energy landscapes begin to involve the sea and coast as well as the land, collaborative and future-oriented social science research has many roles to play.
Marine renewables are an agent of change, potentially restricting traditional activities such as shipping and fisheries and leading to conflict amongst local sea users (Kannen, 2012, Alexander et al., 2013a, Alexander et al., 2013b). These new developments face a situation where information about long-term impacts and cumulative effects is limited and highly uncertain and where long-term time series of data covering this change do not (yet) exist (Kannen, 2012, Kannen et al., 2013, Busch et al., 2013). Given these circumstances, the workshop repeatedly noted the value in learning from experiences in other locations and/or industrial sectors.

In many cases, marine renwable energy development will involve actors and investors from outside coastal areas entering local communities and creating impacts on existing marine activities and associated infrastructure. In contexts such as Orkney, developments are driven mainly by local and regional actors, there is potential to overlap with traditional ways of living and local perceptions of seascape and landscape. Comparative studies on themes such as conflicts and mitigation are inherently useful in minimising the negative impacts of development in peripheral and remote coastal regions.

In this context, comparative studies have two roles:
(a)
From a scientific perspective comparative studies help explore the contextual drivers of community adaptation and the cross-cultural lessons surrounding community acceptance or conflict. Comparative analyses can enable aggregation of results from individual cases to higher levels of analysis at the national or international scale. They provide the opportunity to gain a deeper insight into the complexities and social realities of environmental planning.

(b)
From a practitioner perspective, (policy makers, marine planners, or investors and industry) comparative studies drive a learning process of what works and what does not, an exchange of experience and the identification of “good practice” facilitating the design of better planning and consenting processes. Comparative research may reduce the risk of failure of individual projects, support successful implementation of marine renwable energy policies and achieving renewable energy targets Table 8.

Evaluating Critical Success Factors for Implementing Renewable Energy Strategies in the Dominican Republic,"Global awareness and commitment, in regards to climate change, access to water and renewable energy deployment has risen in the last decade. However, many countries are still locked in unsustainable practices, specifically in regards to energy, this results in damaging consequences not just for the country but the world. Case in point of the Dominican Republic (DR), an island with an immense renewable energy potential, a growing economy and the financial aid of many international entities. Regardless of all this, “the business as usual” decision for the energy strategies is based on fossil foil. As a result, thousands of people are still without energy, the infrastructure itself is unreliable, and the cost of fossil fuel is 8% of the country’s GDP. In addition to, blackouts, the expensive tariff for users and unstable energy grid. Therefore, this paper discusses and critically evaluate critical success factors for implementing renewable energy strategies in the DR. For this purpose, an extensive literature review was done, along with interviews with the key actors in the renewable energy market of the DR. This resulted in the evaluation of the energy infrastructure by obtaining a clear view of the situation. Future work will involve creating a framework for implementation of renewables. It can be deduced from the research each critical success factors augments the possibilities of success. However,
this is not a 100% guarantee that the project will, in fact, succeed there are cases where the
project have failed, and on the contrary, others have succeeded. The important pieces of any  project that must be taken into account, is the identification of the critical success factors, and measures for them that have been correctly implemented properly to achieve a higher possibility of success. critical success factors reveal areas that must be monitored over time. In the case of the DR these areas are: Correct implementation of the legal Framework, as 72% of the key actors highlighted the country has sufficient laws. However, it is in the implementation of the renewable and energy legislation that the actors find insufficient. For this purpose, a re-check of th+B78x. This diversification could be essential to reduce the country dependence on fuel imports and improve the energy supply security considering the fast-growing energy demand. The decentralisation of the grid, as currently 80-88% of the country is connected to one grid, yet the unreliability and instability of the grid still cause several blackouts and grey-outs in the country.

Examining the Key Drivers of Residential Solar Adoption in Upstate New York ,"This research examines the decision factors influencing adoption of residential solar electric power systems in upstate New York. New York has a goal to provide 100% of electric energy in the State through renewable resources, which includes solar electricity, by 2030. Thus, identifying the most important decision factors may be useful in understanding potential means of promoting solar technology adoption. Through an online survey of homeowners in upstate New York who have installed residential solar systems, the research examined the importance of decision factors influencing the decision to adopt and how factors have changed over time. The research finds that environmental motivations are slightly more important than economics and that perception of solar installers is also important to adopters. This work contributes new insights to the field of research examining solar and renewable energy technology adoption at the residential scale, addresses the role of policy in promoting solar adoption, and provides insights for developers and others looking to enhance the rates of solar technology adoption at the residential scale. This study examined solar technology adoption at the residential scale by conducting an online survey that forced respondents to rank decision factors that motivated their choice to adopt. The most important decision factor was positive impact on the environment, with a mean importance score of 4.25. This was followed by expectation of lower energy bills, one of the two economic factors, which was rated as almost equally important to environmental considerations. This finding confirms findings from previous research on solar technology adoption at the residential scale [24] that adopters are motivated by both environmental and economic considerations; therefore, framing solar energy technology based on an exclusive focus on either the environmental or the economic benefits creates an artificially narrow focus that does not align with actual adoption motivations, which recognize both economic and environmental benefits as important.
However, the other economic decision factor, low or no up-front cost, was the eighth most important decision factor. The conclusion of decision factors is that the most important solar decision factor was positive impact on the environment, followed by expected energy bill reduction. Another important finding is the importance of perceived honesty of the solar sales representative, which ranked third in importance when respondents were forced to select their top three reasons for adopting. This decision factor has nothing to do with the environment, economics, or solar itself, but indicates the unexplored role perceptions of trust play in motivating renewable energy technology adoption. Other recent research also indicates that concerns regarding trust are important in shaping perceptions of solar technology development [26]; a recent study on Long Island found that concern that the economic benefits of solar are not equitably distributed, a concern anchored in lack of trust regarding a fair distribution of benefits associated with solar, was the most highly ranked concern about solar development [27]. Previous research suggests that peer effects influence adoption [28], while the current study suggests perceived reputation of installers is more influential.
This research demonstrates that when forced to rank order the decision factors that motivated adoption, economics alone are not sufficient (supporting the qualitative findings of [24]). Both environmental and economic factors matter for adopters, as does perception that installers are trustworthy, and policy makers and industry actors alike can learn from these findings to improve policy design and marketing structures for promoting a renewable energy transition that includes solar technology use at the residential scale. Peers and solar installers have become increasingly important factors over time; these findings can shape the activities of policy makers and solar installers as they seek to promote adoption in the face of declining economic incentivization.
For policy makers, this work suggests that economic incentives may not be the only effective tool for promoting solar technology adoption, and that economic incentives that lower energy costs over the long term rather than lessening the costs of installation in the short term may be effective policy tools. While state RPS policies have promoted solar adoption [7] and financial incentivization clearly helps reduce the up-front economic investment required for solar technology adoption, low and no cost policy tools can also be effective [17]. Given the increased importance of recommendations from peers and the reputations of installers over time, policy decision makers may be able to leverage peer to peer networks or bolster reputations of trustworthy installers as tools to increase market penetration of residential solar. For solar installers, this work suggests the importance of targeted marketing that focuses on both environmental and economic benefits, especially given that their motivational role changes for different groups (men and women).
While this work suggests that women and men are motivated by different factors when thinking about residential solar technology adoption, the survey did not ask about actual decision making roles within the household, and thus one weakness is that this gender based difference in correlation of motivational factors may not directly predict adoption decision making. However, the gendered difference in responses may suggest an avenue for future research or possibilities for targeted marketing. This work also suggests the importance of establishing a reputation of trust when working in communities to promote solar technology adoption at the residential scale.
Future research on solar technology adoption may benefit from explicit exploration regarding the gendered differences in motivations for adoption, and how these differentiations intersects with decision making roles regarding solar technology adoption within the household. Future research may also aim to interrogate the role of particular non-monetary policy incentives that can be used to promote solar. Future research may also benefit from directly exploring the various opportunities and barriers for increasing both transparency and trust in the field of solar development and installation. These considerations regarding trust in development actors and transparency in the economic benefits provided by solar are fruitful areas for research in solar development across many scales, including residential as well as utility scale development.",Sustainability,,
"Expansion of Renewable Energy in Federal Settings: Austria, Belgium, and Germany in Comparison","In the face of accelerating climate change, the transition towards a nonnuclear renewable energy system represents a key political challenge, which can be aggravated by the increasing energy supply uncertainty created by the shift away from fossil fuels. In this article, we conduct a comparison of the expansion of renewable energy sources in Austria, Belgium, and Germany at the level of their subnational units (federal states), thereby covering three economically very important central European federal European Union members. We consider potentially influential factors in a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis: In addition to state-specific socioeconomic and geographical characteristics, political factors, such as parties in government, and specific energy-related policy instruments are included in the analysis. We find that a high potential for renewable electricity expansion in combination with low financial prosperity is most likely to lead to a successful expansion of renewable electricity production from wind and photovoltaics. Over the past two decades, most European democracies have expanded their renewable electricity generation. Nevertheless, we see large variations when it comes to the speed and extent of renewable electricity generation growth in the three federal states of Austria, Belgium, and Germany and their 28 Länder and provinces. Our research reveals two key findings. First, beyond the unsurprising fact that virtually only states with a high expansion potential for renewable energy showed high expansion dynamics between 2003 and 2013,9 it is above all economically poor states that were able to achieve the greatest success. When a generous national support scheme is in place, state prosperity is not a prerequisite for making the costly expansion to renewables. Rather, poorer states have a greater incentive to exploit their renewable energy potential and profit from the guaranteed financial support provided by a support scheme. Financially well-endowed states with high renewable energy potential are much more reluctant to exploit such incentives. Bavaria is the only exception to this pattern. We conclude from this that the expansion of renewable energy is used by poorer states as part of an economic modernization strategy and a welcome subsidy provided by the central government.10 In line with this finding, many other studies show positive effects from the installation of renewables on local economic development, employment, and municipal value added (the general economic and labor market benefits of the expansion of renewables is discussed in Goetzke & Rave, 2016; Heinbach, Aretz, Hirschl, Prahl, & Salecki, 2014, p. 7). The expansion of renewable energy opens the door for poorer states to initiate a redistribution effect, as small- and medium-sized enterprises and local crafts benefit disproportionately from this decentralized expansion. This is particularly important for poorer states, as they usually do not have many of the large companies that benefited from the old centralized power generation structures.

Beyond this core result, two further results should be mentioned. First, there was no clear Green-party effect detected in the three countries. This is in line with the finding that especially poorer and rural regions that are not among the core constituencies of Green parties are among the most successful expanders. Thus, the creation of renewable energy facilities follows mainly a material motivation in contrast to a postmaterialist conviction. Still, Green parties should not be counted out as they can nevertheless be crucial for establishing generous support schemes at the federal level that make renewable energy expansion for poorer states attractive (see also Schmid & Bornemann, 2019, p. 18). Second, even in federal states, the national level matters much more for energy policy especially because of the support it can provide for renewables than the subnational level. While technically Länder in Austria and Germany could establish their own support schemes, they do not. Ambitious support instruments exist only at the national level. This is in line with our finding that rich federal states do not strongly encourage renewable energy expansion. Although they are in a position to do so, they do not set up elaborate support programs. In contrast, poorer federal states make use of nationwide (generous) support programs to boost their development more generally, and renewable energy, more specifically. Poorer federal states are not in a position to set up elaborate funding programs on their own. The interests from both sides thus come together via policy making at the national rather than the federal state level.

Overall, our results are in line with other findings stressing that party effects matter less (see Stadelmann-Steffen, Rieder, & Strotz, 2020) and that a relatively low level of economic development does not necessarily hinder ambitious renewable energy policies. Further research should take a closer look at why richer states fail to exploit their potential and what kind of regulations at the national, subnational, or even local level (e.g., rules regarding installation of wind turbines) hinder expansion. The climate package submitted by the German government in 2019 might be one example, stipulating that no new wind turbines may be erected or repowered within a minimum distance of 1,000 m from residential areas. At the same time, further cases should be added to the analysis to find out whether feed-in tariffs are really a necessary condition for successful expansion or what other equifinal paths to this outcome exist. Considering that our research covers the earliest phase of the serious growth of new renewable energy sources, there should be further explorable expansion paths because of the subsequent cost reductions, which have been realized in renewable energy technologies. It would be interesting to take a closer look at these developments not only in Western democracies but also worldwide.",The Journal of Environment & Development,,
Exploring local projects for sustainable energy in system transition: local perceptions of success,"In the sustainability transitions literature, ‘success’ is conceived as the transition from an unsustainable system to a sustainable one. However, this view hides a more profound complexity in individual projects which can contribute to system transition. This paper focuses instead on local projects as key sites for change. In two case studies of UK sustainable energy projects, success is shown to be characterised by different causative beliefs held by different people about the problems being addressed, which predetermines solutions to those problems; and hence the nature of success. By acknowledging this multiplicity of success, as perceived by ordinary residents and project organisers as well as transition scholars, ‘narratives of success’ can be recognised, enabling future projects to build on success, and continue along the path to transition. This reconceptualisation provides transition scholars with new ways of understanding and effecting transitions; by focusing on the project level, which is useful in contexts with varying commitment to sustainability. This research demonstrates that there are many different causative beliefs and hence different conceptions of success. The data suggest that it is more likely that projects which are multi-agenda, thereby allowing for pluralism in causative beliefs about success, will be perceived as successful. Local projects are not always ‘protected spaces’ to explore suitable innovations for a sustainability transition; they are focusing on the messy and wicked problems of their locality. However they can still make a contribution to transition if perceived as successful and built upon. And yet, within the world of transition practice, attempts to encourage transitions often take a high level, vision-led approach (Kemp and Loorbach 2003; Climate-KIC 2015). However, in some national contexts a high-level managed approach may not be easy (Hawkey and Webb 2014). In such contexts, individual local projects with non-explicit sustainability transition aims, can provide a way forward.

Sustainable transition research and practice would therefore benefit from this reconceptualisation away from success as concerned with bringing about full sustainability transitions, and to focus on local projects as sites of change. Such a reconceptualisation provides transition theory with a new way of understanding how transitions can happen, and provides practical advice on effecting transitions. A focus on local projects forces individuals and localities into view and demonstrates that in practice, by emphasising narratives of success, local projects can attract support and goodwill that will help build momentum for the next project. This is borne out by the projects discussed here; following the successful completion of SusMo’s Green Streets, SusMo set up a renewable energy mutual, and following the success of BES support was given for an ambitious extension of the project. This positive narrative understanding of success is the sort of dynamic understanding needed to capitalise on projects, allowing transition to emerge on a project by project basis. This paper contributes to this by arguing that local projects can provide the necessary ‘stepping stones’ towards that transition, even if they do not ‘look’ like sustainability transition projects. If it can be argued that individual projects do make a difference at some level of the wider (sustainability) problem, then they can followed up with another project with similar aims, which can capitalise on the small change created by the previous project, and create further change allowing yet another project to take place. Individual projects happen in a locality, to individuals with certain causative beliefs. Local projects must therefore start ‘where those individuals are’, and design projects which suit the context and options that are actually available there. Perceived success can create opportunities for more radical projects. This research also suggests that if some individuals do not perceive the project to be successful, then they are likely to reject proposals for further projects that attempt to build on the first, thereby holding back the wider transition process. SusMo’s co-ordinator saying; ‘I wouldn’t go through with it again. Full stop’ is an example of this. This is supported by Heiskanen et al. (2015), who suggest that theoretical views or guiding visions of transitions are almost irrelevant to actual delivery; local projects and individuals can and will dismiss them if they are not perceived as positive locally.",Technology Analysis & Strategic Management,,
"Exploring the role of organizational support, and critical success factors on renewable energy projects of Pakistan","This study investigates the relationship between critical success factors (critical success factors), organizational support,
and renewable energy project success. The critical success factors with multiple dimensions (communication, team, technical, and environmental) were used in this paper. This study adopts the questionnaire survey approach, and collects data from the construction based renewable energy projects located
in Punjab Province, Pakistan, which comprised 342 valid samples. Partial least-squares structural
equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the theoretical framework. The results confirmed
that three critical success factors i.e. team factors (TF), technical factors (Tech. F), and environmental
factors (EF), have a positive and significant direct relationship with project success. However, communication factors (CF) have a direct but insignificant relationship with project success. Moreover, results
also confirmed the positive mediating role of organizational support between critical success factors and
project success. The empirical outcomes of this study show that these four critical success factors increase the success of renewable energy projects. The outcomes also show that organizational support as
a mediating variable plays a dynamic role in enhancing the tangible success of renewable energy projects. This study contributes through empirical findings in the existing knowledge base for renewable
energy projects. The findings of this study back up the notion that critical success
factors are linked to project performance and project success. The
outcomes of the study show that critical success factors positively
affect the success of renewable energy projects. Moreover, organizational support, as a mediating variable, has a pro-vital
contributive role towards enhancing the actual success of the
projects. Furthermore, the findings of this paper supported by
organizational theory. This indicates that construction-based
renewable energy projects efficiently and effectively used their
critical success factors to enhance the PS. Through a review of literature, this research
identified many important success factors, including (1) communication factors, (2) team factors, (3) technical factors, and (4)
environmental factors. These four critical success factors were dynamic for PS, and
organizational support is a significant component that brings the
sustainable competitive advantage, therefore, increases the success
of the renewable energy projects.
The results of this research recommend some useful, practical
implications for the business stagiest, government policymaker,
and academic researchers. Particularly in Pakistan, constructionbased renewable projects are still in the developing stage. This
study will help the project-oriented construction-based organizations to adapt to the analyzed critical success factors and develop
long-term and short-term strategies that achieve the goals of the
project-based organizations. Based on the above findings, our study
suggests some strategies for construction-based renewable energy
projects in the context of Pakistan. First, the organizations must
develop strategic communication networks based on information
technology. This will help the project managers to better communicate with the project stakeholders. Second, the
construction-based renewable energy projects must encourage the
project team and offer them performance-based incentives. It will
critically impact on project duration, project quality, and project
cost. Third, to increase the technical expertise in renewable energy
projects, the organizations should deploy the competent project
managers, i.e., who know how to schedule and set goals, use project
management technology, develop SOPs, and task lists. Moreover, it
is also suggested that the organizations should enhance the information technology capabilities (information technology infrastructure and information technology competencies) as they are
helpful in improving the technical skills of all employees associated
with the projects. Finally, the organizational policymakers should
also consider natural disasters, the country's political environment,
and the safety of the project custodians. The organizations must
have alternate plans for the natural disasters, e.g., the majority of
the projects are facing an increase in project cost and duration due
to the Covid-19 pandemic during 2020e21. Sometimes in Pakistan,
political violence, resource nationalism, and expropriation actions
can jeopardize the safety and security of the employees, assets, and
supply chains of the projects. The organizational policymakers
must also make some strategies to handle such conditions. Implementing these strategies may not only improve the success of
renewable energy projects but may also be beneficial for other
projects.",Energy,,
"Global renewable energy development: In!uencing factors, trend predictions and countermeasures","Promoting the development and utilisation of renewable energy is the current trend of energy policy in various regions. First, we divide the world into seven regions based on the Engineering News-Record (ENR) regional classification—Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Canada, the United States, Latin America, Europe and Africa—and analyse the status of renewable energy from political, technical, economic and social perspectives. Second, an integration forecasting model is proposed, which includes differential autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), neural network model (NNM), support vector machine model (SVM), and predicts the development prospects of renewable resources by one-way regression in various regions. Finally, corresponding countermeasures are proposed for these seven regions. In this paper, we selected four factors to measure the development of renewable energy, economic factors, political factors, social factors and technical factors, to predict the future development of renewable energy in various regions. Combining the data analysis, we find that the predicted value of the ARIMA model is relatively optimistic, usually the upper bound of the predicted value. The trend of the predicted value of the NN model is relatively flat, usually the lower bound of the predicted value. The predicted data of the SVM model fluctuates significantly. The integrated model combines the characteristics of the three models and obtains more accurate predictions. Then according to the prediction situation of Fig. 21 and Fig. 22, the analysis shows that:
The Asia-Pacific region has the most rapid economic development and the highest demand for electricity in recent years. With the increasing maturity of renewable energy technologies and the consummate policy system for renewable energy, renewable energy development will gradually accelerate and the development of renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific region has great potential.
The Middle Eastern economy has boosted its demand for renewable energy. However, the backwardness of renewable energy utilisation technologies and the imperfect development plans for renewable energy are not conducive to the sustainable development of renewable energy in the Middle East. Therefore, in the next few years, it is predicted that renewable energy in the Middle East will not develop much and renewable energy demand remains basically unchanged.
Canada can develop renewable energy earlier with a higher degree of utilisation and improved relevant policy systems. Although economic development has been slow in recent years, it has ensured steady growth of renewable energy. In the future, it is predicted that the development of renewable energy in Canada will grow on a small scale based on the development of existing renewable energy and the development trend is relatively slow.
The US economy is growing steadily, and renewable energy technologies are developing rapidly. The implementation of sound policies is conducive to rapid growth. Thus, the US energy structure will gradually change, and the use of renewable energy will increase substantially.
Latin America's economic growth is slow, and the low demand for renewable energy, low levels of government credibility and imperfect renewable energy development plans will lead to policy implementation difficulties. Although the amount and proportion of renewable energy generation in Latin America is relatively high at this stage, the development of renewable energy has begun to decline year by year.
Europe has experienced slow economic development in recent years, but it actively advocates the use of renewable energy and environmental protection and strongly supports renewable energy development policies. Developed technology and political drive have promoted the rapid development of renewable energy in Europe. In the future, Europe will be one of the regions with the fastest growth in renewable energy use and the highest proportion of renewable energy.
Africa's economy and demand have developed rapidly in recent years due to the weak economic foundation, underdeveloped technology and imperfect policy system, but only a few countries have the ability to support the rapid development of renewable energy. Based on the current stage, Africa's renewable energy development process tends to be at a standstill.",Resources Policy,,
"Green innovation and green Imports:Links between environmental policies, innovation, and production","This paper addresses the claim that environmental policies stimulate domestic economies. The claim is parsed into two sequential parts: the effect of policies on innovation and the effect of that innovation on resulting manufacturing production. Each of these activities -- innovation and manufacturing -- can either take place at home or abroad, and where they take place determines the consequences for the domestic economy. The empirical evidence is based on measures of policy, patent activity, and trade in the renewable energy sector of 31 OECD countries between 1988 and 2003. The results from regression analysis suggest that renewable energy policies have had some success in stimulating domestic economies. While renewable energy policies are associated with little domestic innovation outside of Germany, Japan, and the United States, they do boost the adoption of foreign technologies overall. In turn, when patenting occurs the results detect an increase in manufacturing production of renewable energy technologies as well as a rise of the country's international competitiveness through exports.
The sheer magnitude of the political and monetary capital being invested into greening the economy around the world suggests the need for academic research on the links between environmental regulation, green innovation, and green manufacturing. However, the theory is inconclusive so the question of whether environmental policies stimulate the domestic economy is mainly an empirical one.

The framework devised here to identify those links is straightforward. Environmental policies affect two main levels of economic activity: innovation and manufacturing. These activities can take place at home or abroad, allowing for four possible scenarios: both innovation and manufacturing occur domestically, both happen abroad, only innovation is domestic, or only manufacturing is produced at home. The most prominent scenario is identified in two steps, each posing a different question and requiring different data and estimation techniques.

In the first step, using patent data as a proxy for innovation and a measure of policy strength specific to renewable energies, the analysis finds that renewable energy policies result in a 30 percent increase in patent filings, but few of these are developed by domestic inventors. Only in historically innovative economies such as Germany, Japan, and the United States do domestic inventors respond significantly to the implementation of a policy. In the rest of the OECD, adopted technologies are largely licensing of foreign technologies rather than new technologies developed at home. However, examining the four renewable technologies individually reveals that policies aimed at solar are associated with a statistically significant but economically small increase in domestic production.

In the second step, the paper asks whether the increase in technology adoption led to a spike in domestic manufacturing production or to a rise in imports. Results show that domestic production – proxied by exports – increased significantly following technology adoption and the effect is strongest for the wind industry. At least some of the technologies or the inputs into these technologies are manufactured domestically. Combining the two steps of the paper, an additional renewable energy policy in the OECD is associated with a 4.38 percent rise in domestic production through the innovation channel, and a further effect directly on manufacturing. Therefore, the evidence suggests that renewable policies in the OECD stimulate the economy through manufacturing but much less through innovation outside of a few select countries.",Journal of Environmental Management,,
Grid Stability Battery Systems for Renewable Energy Success,"Abstract -- A123 Systems (A123) has deployed over 20
MW’s of NanophosphateTM battery-based systems that are
currently providing Ancillary Services in wholesale electric
markets. Ancillary Services include Frequency Regulation
and Spinning Reserves. This paper outlines A123’s early
ground breaking grid battery systems. It describes their
characteristics and the applications that these energy storage
systems are used for today. The paper then discusses how
these characteristics and capabilities implemented in A123’s
current multi-MW scale battery systems can be extended and
applied to support increased delivery of clean renewable
energy while maintaining reliable and secure grid
performance. Renewable resources capacity, and in particular wind
generation capacity, is expanding significantly and will help
achieve RPS targets in California, and in other U.S. States.
At the same time, advances in the characteristics,
functionalities, and scale of grid storage is progressing as
evidenced by A123’s and others’ commercially deployed
multi-MW storage systems that are being used to sell
Frequency Regulation. These advances in energy storage
technology’s characteristics and resulting functional
capabilities can be applied to improve the grid’s ability to
accommodate more renewable energy, above and beyond
using energy storage to simply change the timing of when
energy produced by a renewable resource is delivered to load.
The author hopes to further develop these grid-oriented
energy storage application concepts, including dynamic
damping enabled through synchrophaser-aided energy
storage control schemes, and more rigorously test these
concepts’ potential technical value and relevance through
additional simulation and analysis. ",IEEE,,
Growing China’s renewables sector: a developmental state approach,"Over the last decade China expanded its renewable energy sector with unprecedented speed. This success story presents a challenge to Western modes of environmental governance, where stakeholder participation is often deemed a necessary pre-condition for effective policy outcomes. Drawing on new research (including previously unpublished interview data), the article first discusses established modes of environmental governance before examining the growth of China’s renewables sector through the theoretical lens of the ‘developmental state’. The article then analyses renewable energy policy design and implementation in China, illustrating how top-down command and control strategies have successfully diffused renewable energy technology from a standing start. We argue that (1) China’s distinct approach to the sector differs from Western modes of environmental governance and (2) this has revealed a new path towards renewable energy diffusion that authoritarian states in particular might regard as an attractive alternative to participatory models. We can see how hook responsibility operates in the area of solar energy, where in 2010 the Ministry of Finance issued the Notice of the Organisation of Solar Photovoltaic Building Demonstration Project, under which solar photovoltaic building-integration projects received unified support through two sets of price subsidies19 (Wang et al. 2012: 80). In the same year, central government also introduced the so-called Golden Sun Scheme, with the aim of scaling up a photovoltaic industry that was henceforth to be regarded as one of China’s ‘strategic emerging industries’ (Zhanlue xinxing chanye, 战略新兴产业). The policy regulated equipment for the tender, subsidy standards, supervision and management of energy projects. Fifty per cent of price subsidies were provided through a unified bidding process for demonstration projects using crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules, grid-connected inverters, and lead-acid batteries (Wang et al. 2012: 81). As discussed earlier, this ‘unified’ pricing policy left little local discretion within the top-down chain of command between central government, the provinces, and local government.

China’s development state approach is not just limited to top-down command and control measures. For instance, the early development of the photovoltaic equipment manufacturing industry took place in a relatively decentralised fashion where, as Gallager points out (2014: 222–4), local manufacturing was boosted by individual technical and academic experts, especially those returned from overseas with knowledge of modern climate technology. A number of private, local solar and wind power equipment manufacturers rapidly emerged with government support,20 such as the Chinese Electric Equipment Group for solar energy and Ming Yang for wind power sector – although state-owned enterprises such as Goldwind continued to dominate market share (Lewis 2013: 161–2). Development of the sector was boosted by cultivated interaction between state, academia and industry in the kind of corporatist networks we associate with the developmental state paradigm. One of our interviewees indicated that, as the lead agency for the sector, the NDRC closely cooperated with the China Association for Science and Technology. Moreover, in Jiangsu Province the provincial Energy Research Society took responsibility for the development and execution of technology projects and also drafted the Eleventh and Twelve Five-Year strategies for energy conservation for the Jiangsu Provincial government. As our interviewee observed: ‘in the last fifteen years, under Premier Li’s encouragement, civil society has taken on more and more of the duties assigned by the government’.21 The harnessing of all levels of government and civil society was also advocated in the 2006 Opinions of the State Council for Invigorating Equipment Manufacturing, to mobilise educational institutions to build human capital and also to facilitate catch up in key technologies and equipment (Article 3.4–3.9). Again this is consistent with the developmental state’s emphasises on the significance of human capital for modernisation.

It is clear that, after a period of trial and error, the Chinese communist party now considers the developmental state paradigm to be the appropriate model, given the trade-off between the need to cultivate quasi-market dynamics whilst retaining central steering capacity. This pattern is somewhat at odds with the energy sector as a whole, in which a more decentralised model is the norm (Andrews-Speed 2012) and might reflect the relative failure of some aspects of China’s modernisation process where central control has been less apparent.22 This supports Jessop’s notion of the constitutive and evolving relationship between ‘modes’ and ‘objects’ of governance (Jessop 2005). The defining feature of China’s renewables governance is the degree to which the main parameters – including how tariffs are set, the degree to which local government can adapt central government policy, and so on – are determined by the NDRC. Consistent with the developmental paradigm, the NDRC has considerable operational autonomy, framing the renewables sector as a ‘strategic’ modern Pillar Industry, levering corporate networks, and rapidly growing China’s installed capacity of renewable energy, as well as overseeing the expansion of the global market share in equipment manufacturing. The sector has been guided by a centralised, and professionalised leadership with the goal of upgrading the sector in order to catch up with and eventually overtake advanced Western states. Such a strategy was ultimately driven by the imperative of state building rather than environmental protection. But in doing so, it has nevertheless overseen the expansion of the Chinese renewables industry from a standing start to world-class status.

Conclusions
This article shows how the rapid expansion of the renewables sector in China and the associated scaling-up process have not followed the sustainable development paradigm that we see in different forms in the West, characterised by varying degrees of participatory governance, decentralisation and the inclusion of societal actors.

On the contrary, this study demonstrates that the expansion of renewable energy in China was characterised by the enhancement of central steering capacity, consistent with the developmental state paradigm. In the Chinese model, neither market efficiency nor increasing societal participation was a priority for restructuring the energy market. Instead, central government securitised the sector through re-centralisation and re-intervention, giving priority to political stability through its lead agency, the NDRC.

This article demonstrates that the emerging model of renewable energy governance in China re-emphasises what many environmental governance theorists have regarded as a thing of the past: top-down command and control policy instruments levered by a strong state. China will not give up its bureaucratic system-monitoring mechanisms and remains actively involved in the developmental process. It has created a ‘definite mode’ of governance (Jessop 1997) that is appropriate to the sector in China and the role it plays in political-economic terms as a Pillar Industry. The apparent success of this strategy poses a challenge to Western modes of governance as it provides an attractive alternative for authoritarian states elsewhere in the world that may wish to address their environmental problems but do not wish to cede political or economic control in order to do so.",New Political Economy,,
How robust is the renewable energy industry to political shocks? Evidence from the 2016 U.S. elections,"Climate change mitigation relies increasingly on clean technologies such as renewable energy. Despite widespread success, further deployment of renewables has been met with resistance from voters and governments in several countries. How resilient is the renewable energy industry to adverse political events? I use the unexpected election of Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential race to study this question. As a vocal critic of renewables and a supporter of fossil fuels, his election is a plausible negative shock to the renewable energy sector. I examine stock market data to gauge the reaction of investors. I find that renewable energy stocks were adversely affected by the election. Overall, they experienced a cumulative abnormal loss in share values of about 6 percent on average over the twenty days that followed the election. However, I find that the negative effect is concentrated among non-U.S. firms. U.S. firms, on average, emerged unscathed. Non-U.S. companies, on the other hand, lost over 14 percent of their value in the aftermath of the election. This suggests that markets are more concerned by increasing obstacles to international business than a decrease of federal support for renewables. The clean energy transition has come a long way. Renewable energy, from being an insignificant source of power ten years ago, has grown into a large contributor to energy supply. From a climatic standpoint, this is welcome news. The global climate regime is now dependent on the successful continuation of this process. In this context, findings suggesting voters started to push back against renewables are possibly worrisome. While the long-term perspectives remain positive, the short- and medium-term perspectives are less clear. At this stage, the question remains open: Is the renewable energy industry robust to political shocks?

In this paper, I looked for an answer in the case of the United States. Taking advantage of the 2016 presidential elections, I examined whether the renewable energy sector had become resilient to an adverse shock. Given his hostility toward renewables and his open support for fossil fuels, Donald Trump's election represents a good test case to evaluate the robustness of the renewable energy sector. The immediate response of stock markets was undoubtedly negative. Renewable stocks were hammered. Even ignoring the immediate reaction and taking a long-run perspective (of about three weeks), I found that the value of renewable energy companies suffered from substantial losses. The implication is that policies still play an important role in the welfare of the renewable energy sector. However, I also found that the losses are concentrated in firms located abroad. How can we interpret these findings? One possible interpretation is that renewable energy companies abroad are at the mercy of potential trade disputes or other shocks that affect non-U.S. companies disproportionately. As a candidate, Donald Trump has mentioned several times the possibility of raising trade barriers across different sectors. Possibly, his election increased the likelihood of obstacles put in front of non-U.S. companies. Firms based in the United States, on the other hand, would be mostly shielded from such a policy. More generally, investors might worry that the federal government may put in place regulations that discriminate against non-U.S. firms. In sharp contrast with earlier administrations, the new administration has regularly expressed skepticism over the importance of maintaining a liberal world order.

This could be a significant problem for climate governance. As several observers noted, international energy markets tend to be highly globalized.70 Given that the Paris Agreement relies heavily on technological improvements, integrated markets are excellent news, because they facilitate the flow of knowledge across the world. Obstacles to these flows could jeopardize the global deployment of renewable energy. Thus, if President Trump were to implement the kind of barriers that markets appear to expect, the assumptions underlying the Paris Agreement may not be met.

This paper contributes and generates new research questions in two areas. First, renewable energy interests might exhibit conflicting preferences. This is a consequence of state-induced growth: As long as renewable energy companies depend on some measures of public support, their preferences might clash along country lines. Symptomatic for this is the increase in trade disputes on renewable energy.71 A firm in the United States may find it to be in its interest to support trade barriers. Thus, just like scholars of trade argue that there can be conflicting interests within an industry, scholars of energy transitions might observe lobbying battles between renewable energy companies. Indeed, Meckling and Hughes's (2017) study on solar photovoltaic suggests that the renewable energy industry is far from a homogeneous bloc. Future research that builds on models of renewable energy policymaking may wish to study the existence of other sources of tension within the renewable energy industry.72 As global competition intensifies, lobbying might not operate along sectoral lines.

Second, the reason for the lack of effect in the United States needs to be investigated further. One possibility is that U.S. firms are more competitive than foreign ones. This seems unlikely, given that some of the largest players such as Vestas and Yingli, are located abroad. Another possibility is that investors do not believe that President Trump will cut back on federal support for renewables. This is possible though remains an open question. Yet another reason is related to the multilevel governance of energy in the United States.73 Many important policies are under the control of state authorities and therefore beyond the reach of the White House. Even though the federal government plays an important role (for instance, through its environmental regulations), state authorities respond to different logics. Local renewable companies may benefit from valuable local connections to weather national shocks. Further research in the political economy of U.S. renewable energy could shed useful light on this question.",Business and Politics,,
Hybrid Predictive Decision-Making Approach to Emission Reduction Policies for Sustainable Energy Industry,"Carbon emissions are a prominent issue for sustainable energy production and management. Energy policies under the growing competitive environment could change the priorities of emission reduction and investment decisions. This paper aims to forecast carbon emissions from China and to rank the importance of carbon emissions with interval type 2 (IT2) fuzzy sets (FS) for sustainable energy investments. For this purpose, the quadratic model is applied to measuring emission trends and the Qualitative Flexible Multiple Criteria Method (QUALIFLEX) is used for measuring sustainable energy investment alternatives by the several emission levels. Forecasted values of 29 provinces in China are converted into the linguistic and fuzzy numbers based on IT2 FS respectively to measure the priorities of emission reduction for sustainable economies. The novelty of this paper is to propose a hybrid decision-making approach based on quadratic modeling and the QUALIFLEX method and to discuss the overall energy emission trend and policies for sustainable economic growth. The results demonstrate that emission reduction policies are the most important phenomenon and the environmental factors should be widely considered to construct sustainable energy investments and production. This study aims to propose a two-stage analysis for analyzing the sustainable energy investment policies in China by considering the different levels of emission reduction potential in the provinces. To achieve this objective, Chinese overall data and provincial data are taken into consideration for the periods between 2005 and 2017. Hence, the future trends of absolute and relative emission targets can be obtained. Because of a data availability problem, the data in 2018 cannot be considered. However, because a large period is included in the analysis, it is believed that this evaluation is consistent and represents the current situation. In the second stage of the analysis, calculated future carbon emission targets are converted into linguistic variables. After that, the decision matrix of high, moderate, and low emission reduction targets for the provinces of China is constructed by using IT2 fuzzy QUALIFLEX. The main advantage of selecting this method is that it is very successful to rank three different alternatives. Additionally, it is also seen that the QUALIFLEX methodology was mainly preferred with fuzzy logic especially in recent studies. Hence, in the second part of the analysis process, expert opinions are accounted for. It is thought that this situation also increases the quality of the analysis. The results demonstrate that high emission reduction targets are mainly considered in China for sustainable energy investments. In other words, it is concluded that China intends to reduce the future carbon emission problem. This is important for energy investment projects in China. It is possible to look at this from two different angles. First of all, it is important to prevent important problems such as carbon emissions, so that energy projects can find funding. The main reason for this is that international fund organizations pay attention to environmental factors in their lending decisions. In this context, in a country with high carbon emissions, it becomes very difficult for energy projects to find funding. China stands out as a country with high air pollution. Hence, it is thought that the high target of reducing carbon emissions in China decreases the risk of not finding funds for energy projects in the country. Many different authors identified a similar situation in their studies. However, the main novelty of this study is that the level of the emission reduction targets can be identified for different provinces of China to make sustainable energy investments. Therefore, by making this kind of detailed analysis, it is thought that this study becomes very different by comparing the similar ones in the literature. Additionally, most of the studies only focused on the significance of the carbon emission problem in the effectiveness of energy investment policies. Nevertheless, this study also measured the level of the targets that China should implement. In other words, this study examined how urgent the actions should be taken to solve the problems.
Herbohn et al. [71] aimed to understand whether banks consider carbon risk in their lending decisions. For this purpose, 120 different bank loans are taken into consideration regarding the period between 2009 and 2015. They underlined that banks give importance to the carbon risk to the lending process. Similarly, Zhou et al. [72] focused on the effect of carbon risk on the lending decisions of the financial institutions. They made a panel regression analysis on 191 Chinese companies for the years between 2011 and 2019. It is concluded that necessary actions should be taken to manage carbon emission risks for the companies to reach funds from the financial institutions easily.
This situation explained by many different studies in the literature. For instance, Shamsi et al. [73] created an optimization model and identified that emission reduction targets play a key role to minimize this problem. Kuriyama et al. [74] tried to make a similar analysis for Japan. They underlined that emission reduction targets should be designed to provide sustainable energy investments. Similarly, Qin et al. [75] and Pollitt et al. [76] are other studies that defined the importance of this situation as well. On the other side, there are also some studies in the literature which argue that low and medium emission levels should be mainly considered. For example, Wang et al. [77] focused on carbon emission reduction targets in China. They concluded that the areas with the highest carbon emission control target level have higher costs so that low and medium emission levels are more important for China’s sustainable development.
The second important aspect of this result is the increase in renewable energy investments as a result of being sensitive to the environment. When China generally has a carbon emission reduction target, this will allow for energy projects that do not cause environmental pollution. In other words, this will attract renewable energy investors. Renewable energies are the types of energy that originate from nature such as wind and sun. They do not emit carbon gas like non-renewable energy. Therefore, China’s goal of reducing carbon emissions will contribute to the increase in renewable energy investments in the country. This situation contributes to the sustainability of energy investments and economic size in the country. Lots of studies in the literature underlined the importance of this situation. For instance, Inglesi-Lotz [78] and Kahia et al. [79] also reached similar points by analyzing different regions, such as the EU and MENA. By considering the results of the analysis, it can be said that the acceleration of the optimization and adjustment of Chinese energy structure means reducing dependence on fossil fuels such as coal and oil and vigorously developing new and renewable energy sources.
(1)
Coal energy dependence reduction. It needs to rationally control domestic coal production and strengthen the overall planning and management of mining areas. It requires not only limiting the total annual production of coal enterprises, but also merging and reorganizing coal enterprises, integrate small coal enterprises, and implement coal quota management for large coal enterprises. Next, we will increase publicity and guidance, and encourage all industries and enterprises to use coal without gas, which can use oil without oil, and reduce coal consumption.
(2)
Stabilize the supply of petroleum energy. Chinese oil energy is half reliant on imports, and stable oil energy supply plays an important role in Chinese national energy security. Besides, it is necessary to increase the strategic reserve of domestic oil, encourage enterprises to increase the pace of oil exploration in areas such as the deep sea, and comprehensively promote the construction of national oil reserve projects. To encounter the domestic petroleum energy demand in the case of blocked international trade to increase trade cooperation between China, Russia, and Africa, we should make full use of Central Asia, China, and Russia and other pipelines to maximize the import of petroleum resources from abroad.

The proportion should be increased in energy supply and consumption of natural gas, wind energy, hydropower, solar energy, and nuclear energy. China should give priority to the development of hydropower. Hydropower is an economical, clean renewable energy source. The development of hydropower can also achieve comprehensive benefits such as flood control, irrigation, water supply, shipping, aquaculture, and tourism; compared with coal-fired power, hydropower per 1 kWh can reduce carbon emissions by about 1100 g. The Three Gorges Project is equivalent to seven 2.6 million kilowatts of thermal power plants, which can emit about 100 million tons of carbon per year. Thus, hydropower development is a vital choice for China to solve the problem of optimizing energy structure and reducing carbon emissions. Besides, natural gas, coal-bed methane, and shale gas should also be established; nuclear power should be energetically settled; wind energy construction should be supported; solar energy, biomass energy, and other renewable energy sources should be vigorously industrialized.",Energies,,
Hybrid PSO-TS Based Distribution System Expansion Planning for System Performance Improvement Considering Energy Management,"Energy management (EM) has become very attractive in smart grid era for both industry and academia. EM in a power distribution system (PDS) can reduce the system losses, operational costs and emissions, and increases system's reliability, voltage stability and efficiency. This article expands the PDS using different distributed energy resources (DERs) and observes their impacts on EM success, operational costs, system losses, and emissions. Moreover, the impacts of integrating reactive sources (RSs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and electric vehicles (EVs) on the system's operational performance is investigated. An index is defined to measure the energy management success rate (EMSR) and several case studies are created for investigating variety of system expansion options individually and collectively. Furthermore, a new reliability index, namely reliability index success rate (RISR), is defined and sensitivity analysis are presented to investigate the distributed energy resources impacts on system's voltage controllability and the defined reliability index. A new hybrid PSO-TS optimization algorithm is developed, and the well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution network is selected for the simulations. Several case studies presented in the paper provide a clear understanding of the impacts of integrating different resources on the EM as well as other operational aspects of a power distribution system. The results reveal that the system expansion using distributed energy resources  with different capacities along with Energy management  strategies could have significant impacts on PDS performance depending on the distributed energy resources types' and capacities. Due to their availability and low operational costs, gas turbine further improves the performance indices comparing to the renewables that have uncertain availability and to diesel generators with their high operational costs. This article investigates power distribution system expansion using different penetration levels of distributed energy resources and analysis their impacts on energy management success. The overall system performance in terms of operational costs, system losses, and environmental emissions is also evaluated during system expansion. As further enhancements, the impacts of integrating different levels of reactive sources, energy storage systems, and EVs on operational issues are also investigated. A hybrid PSO and TS based optimization method has been applied in this research renamed as hybrid PSO-TS that is a more powerful heuristic-based algorithm specifically in this high dimension optimization problem. The PG&E 69 bus system has been used as the test system for the simulations and case studies. The results show that integration of different istributed energy resources along with EM strategies could have positive or negative impacts on power distribution system  performance depending on the istributed energy resources types. Diesel generator, gas turbine, and biomass have more impact on reducing system losses while PVs, wind turbine, and biomass have more impact in reducing environmental impacts. Moreover, this research shows that reactive sources, energy storage systems, and EVs along with istributed energy resources, play a significant role in achieving operational goals of the power distribution system. Lastly, sensitivity analysis has been done for analyzing voltage controllability and reliability of power distribution system by calculating VCI,reliability index, and reliability index success rate . The case studies presented in this article provides information for power engineers to compare different system’s performance indices during integration of different DERs and helps them make more reasonable decisions while expanding traditional PDSs using different types of reactive sources, energy storage systems and EVs. As future work, the system can be expanded by considering different planning and operational performance indices, e.g. system’s resiliency. The indices could be combined with different weights based on their importance for the distribution system operator. Moreover, incentive-based policies could be designed and considered during expansion planning for profit-oriented entities, utilities and consumers to promote the renewable-based distributed energy resources integration for a more environment friendly energy system.",IEEE,,
IDENTIFYING THE CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS AND THEIR RELEVANT ASPECTS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS; AN EMPIRICAL PERSPECTIVE,"Owed to their enormous impact on the sustainable development of energy security, climate change, and the economy, multiple renewable-energy projects are carried out around the world, both in developed and in developing countries. Since the construction of renewable energy project is an entrepreneurial activity, there is a big concern about the success of such projects. Although pertinent literature suggests several methodologies to enhance the success of various projects, renewable-energy projects are still overlooked. This study identifies multiple critical success factors (critical success factors), required for renewable-energy projects. Using a sample of 272 firms working on renewable energy projects in Pakistan, a quantitative and causal study was undertaken to identify the critical success factors (critical success factors). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to test and verify hypothesis. The results show that there is a strong direct dependency of project suc- cess over the proposed factors, however environmental factors are found to be the only predominant critical success factors which show the significant indirect effect on project success. The study expected to contribute towards and widen up the existing know- ledge base for the project performance of renewable energy projects by adding on the findings regarding critical success factors.
This paper has presented the relationship and impact of critical success factors vis-à-vis project success in construction of renewable energy projects. The present study is the very first attempt in research to present a causal model for determining critical success factors in renewable energy projects. Clustering the critical success factors (critical success factors) for renewable energy projects and determining significant sub-factors in all the relevant categories is the significant contribution of the present study. Several success factors have been identified via literature review and earlier case studies, and correspondence and survey interviews with professionals and experts of renewable energy projects. Further, these success factors are evaluated, refined, cod- ed, and lastly classified into five major critical success factors categories: 1) communication factors, 2) team factors, 3) technical factors, 4) organizational factors, and 5) environmental factors.
A significantly positive association was verified through correlation values and SEM among project critical success factors and pro- ject success of renewable energy projects. Additionally, the mediating relation of four critical success factors (team factors, techni- cal factors, organizational factors, and environmental fac- tors) was also observed between communication factors (independent variable) and project success (dependent variable). The proposed model conceptualized the theory that project success in renewable energy projects are due to five major types of critical success factors (critical success factors) name- ly; communication factors, team factors, technical factors, organizational factors, and environmental factors; how- ever, it is also observed that only environmental factors significantly mediates the connections between project success and project communication factors. The presented model claims a contribution to further extend the concept of project development with the help of critical success factors in renewable energy projects, which have hardly been studied in the ex- isting academic works of literature. Moreover, the analysis and comparison with earlier researches purport worthy contribution in the present study. The present study will not only contribute to fill up the literary gap as discussed above, nevertheless will also as- sist project firms in weighing the critical success factors from a different perspective that has not been touched up till now. The present study will help towards widening up the current knowledge base for the critical success factors (critical success factors) by adorning the research findings vis-à-vis their impact on the success of the renewable energy projects. Since the renewable project is at a developing stage of germinate in Pakistan, a study of the critical success factors should lead a better perspec- tive of the factors persuading the success or otherwise of renewable projects. This can pave the way for effective decision making in opting the suitable projects (for which the critical success factors can be guaranteed or managed in some way) and in the enhanced administration of those already embarked upon. Conforming effective approaches based on those identified critical success factors can also be made for successfully resulting future renewable energy projects for accelerated excellence. It is believed that this study has helped to describe the perspectives of Pakistani renewable energy experts in their estimation of critical success factors for renewable energy projects in Pakistan.Nevertheless, readers must take into account that there will be the consistent development of critical success factors for renew- able energy projects from the time of data gathering till the time of paper publication. The present study will also lay the first stone for new direction to upcoming schol- ars in executing the research at the international level with an intent to find out concrete recommendations for war- ranting performance in sustainable as well as renewable projects. Though the critical success factors are determined for renewable energy projects and their relationship is analyzed with project success, still the study is not without limitations. Future researches are expected to be carried out across the industries and countries in order to identify differences in between different industrial settings and in different cultural implications upon these success factors. So that results may be generalized in multiple countries. The relation of communication factors and project success was constructed by Holland and Light (1999) and Shenhar et al. (1997). This relation was tested in the construction industry of Pakistan and was found correct hence its generalizability can be promoted to the construction industry as well. Other part was the testing of mediations if they cause any alteration in the effects. It was noted that only environmental factors were significant in mediating the effect of communication factors over project success. Internal as well as the external environment of the construction organizations arose to be an imperative factor for the accomplishment of the final product and the project management processes. Wüste and Schmuck (2012) and Rajkumar (2010) also discussed that environmental factors influence communication factors for attaining project success. Other than environmental factors rest of all, which are team, technical, and organizational factors, were not mediating the communication effect on project success. The results are unique to Pakistani context and may also be discovered in other parts as well if are tried to dig out. The failure rate of renewable projects worldwide
is alarming, and these results of no mediation might also be a continuation to that. As these projects mainly fail due to their poor quality of the final product which is not as was promised or due to the failure of project management which mainly go beyond the boundary of cost, time, and scope All the five critical success factors categories were concluded to be imminent for successful construction of renewable energy projects. However, this study does not offer support to the hypotheses that three critical success factors categories, namely; team factors, technical factors, and organizational factors contribute to mediate the relationship between communication factors project success. As the communication factors were vital for project management of the construction of renewable energy project so as the environmental
factors were important gear to enhance the relationship between communication factors and project success. Furthermore, environmental factors were found to be predominant critical success factors category which can mediate between communication factors and project success.The environmental factors which influence the project while mediating the communication factors are; political situation, legal environment, credit management system, peace situation and local community influence. The role of the Pakistani government and legislation bodies is most important to formulate such policies which could help the project investors, moreover ensure about its safe capital and assets in the country. Government should formulate such kind of incentive policies for the industry which can
help to lower the project construction and power generation cost. According to Zhao et  al. (2017), incentive policies such as preferential loans, tax support and zero land cost for power stations play significant role for constructing renewable energy projects. Firms should also consider the internal as well as the external environment, which can play an important role in the success or failure of the renewable project. Similarly, the project success depends upon the cohesiveness and support for each other among the project organizations and the level of support and cooperation between government and legislation departments. Resultantly; this paves its way towards friendly atmosphere among project stakeholders; which can further contribute towards added efficiency to the success of renewable energy projects in the country",Journal of Civil Engineering and Management,,
Identifying the Drivers of Wind Capacity Additions: The Case of Spain. A Multiequational Approach,"An abundant volume of literature has been devoted to the analysis of the drivers of renewable electricity capacity additions in general and wind energy in particular. Nevertheless, whereas the direct influence of several explanatory variables has been considered, indirect effects, which refer to impacts of explanatory variables on another explanatory variable which, in turn, influence capacity additions, have been neglected. However, those effects need to be taken into account in order to properly grasp the full influence of the explanatory variables in general, and the policy variable in particular, on capacity additions (whether in wind energy generation or other energy systems). The aim of this paper is to identify the drivers of wind energy capacity additions. Based on data over the 1998–2015 period for Spain, a country with a substantial deployed wind capacity, we estimate a three-stage least squares multiecuational econometric model, which allows the analysis of direct and indirect effects as mediated by their influence on intermediate variables. Our results show that, as expected, wind capacity additions are positively and significantly driven by renewable energy support and negatively driven by the material costs of wind energy. Other variables are related to capacity additions in an indirect manner, i.e., through their influence on intermediate variables, i.e., electricity demand and electricity prices. This includes the positive impact of GDP, wind share, capacity load and price of oil. Others have a negative impact (tax share in the electricity price and electricity transport costs). Finally, no statistically significant relationship can be observed for the risk premium, interest rates and the price of gas. Our findings suggest that the success of renewable energy policy instruments might be contingent upon the level of other variables and, particularly, electricity consumption. This paper has identified the drivers of wind energy capacity additions in Spain over the period 1998-2015 through the estimation of a three-stage least squares multiecuational econometric model, which allows the analysis of direct and indirect effects as mediated by their influence on two intermediate variables (electricity demand and electricity prices).
Our results show that, as expected, wind capacity additions are positively and significantly driven by renewable energy support (in the form of feed-in premiums and tariffs). The absence of support since 2012 led to a stagnation of wind capacity additions in this country. Interestingly, our results suggest that the impact of FITs/FIPs on wind deployment is mediated by the influence (level) of other variables. In other words, the success of renewable energy policy instruments is contingent upon the level of those variables.
In contrast, our results regarding the influence of technology costs are mixed. On the one hand, the material costs of wind energy (proxied by the price of iron) have had a negative effect on wind capacity additions. On the other hand, the financing costs (proxied by interest rates) are not statistically significant in the econometric estimations. This is probably related to the type of investors in wind capacity in Spain: large investors which have been able to finance their investments with equity rather than debt. The lack of statistical significance of the investment conditions (proxied by the risk premium) suggests that access to credit has not been a barrier. They may have been problematic only in the last years of the considered period, coinciding with the worst years of the economic/financial crisis, which led to severe credit restrictions. But these were also the years when cost-containment mechanisms on the support scheme and the moratoria were adopted. Our results suggest that those unfavourable policy conditions played a more relevant role than the access to credit restrictions. This stresses the importance of policy framework conditions, in contrast to the traditional focus in the literature on specific RES deployment instruments.
Contrary to expectations, gas prices have not played a significant role in explaining wind capacity additions. This might be related to the fact that wind does not compete with gas or, more likely, that gas prices were simply not part of the decision by investors to invest in wind energy capacity additions because other variables were more relevant in this regard. Nevertheless, oil prices have a significant impact on wind capacity additions.
Finally, the fact that wind capacity additions and a higher wind capacity factor positively influence further wind capacity additions through a lower electricity price due to a higher penetration of wind electricity (merit order effect), leading to a higher electricity demand, is an interesting result, which is against the argument that wind can be the victim of its own success.",Energies,,
Impactful engineering education through sustainable energy collaborations with public and private entities,"This paper aims to report on a case study concerning the development of sustainable energy partnerships involving engineering faculty and undergraduate students at the University of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. Through the provision of technical expertise, the adoption and success of renewable energy projects was facilitated on the one hand, while final year undergraduate students benefited in terms of hands-on experience in helping to bring these projects to life, drawing on the knowledge and skills they had acquired throughout their degree programmes. These works are addressed to students by faculty members with the aim of developing and promoting renewable energies. Outcomes from partnerships surpassed expectations; not only were different benefits realised as were initially hoped for, but this success led to partnerships being sustained over time. Synergies between universities and external entities must be explored. Contacts with local institutions become essential because local sustainable resources and social needs are aligned with the Sustainable Development. The partnership between the Ordis Council and the University of Girona has provided support for developing the use of the sustainable energy sources. A network for local sustainable development has been established and new partnership entities have been contacted which allows the collaboration and future research. Within this context, the Ordis Council is aware of the quality of life of their citizens as well as the influence towards their attitudes. For these reasons, divulgation of results among citizens is an important challenge.

Sustainable energies and climate change mitigation are important educational issues that universities should include in their curricula across a wide variety of different disciplines, including but not limited to STEM subjects. Without dedication to meeting this objective, society is unlikely to be able to meet the challenges associated with avoiding and ameliorating negative environmental externalities. In this work, it is focused on describing and exploring collaborations for sustainable energy which were pursued by the University of Girona. These collaborations were a win-win in the sense that they provided practical educational experiences to engineering undergraduates while realising important environmental and social objectives. A key message from these experiences is that sustainable energy sources do not pose unique engineering challenges in many respects. In this way, students pursuing degrees such as electrical engineering, industrial electronics, automation engineering and mechanical engineering, are able to develop research projects related to sustainable energy sources despite having followed curricula containing few specific subjects in this domain. There could be important implications of this observation in terms of increasing the number of engineering professionals who work on sustainable energy projects in the future. In addition, the teaching staff is gaining experience, creativity, effectivity and society engagement from the partnership. The learning process is relearned outside the university walls according to the social needs that arise from local entities.

The method presented allows active learning achievement through CA of outcomes with local community. Moreover, other university challenges, as the contribution to ethics values of the society (solidarity, openness and creativity) are considered by using this methodology. The authors wish that this case study can motivate other universities to search local partnership with public and private institutions with the aim of promoting sustainability.",International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education ,,
Implementing Traceability Systems in Specific Supply Chain Management (SCM) through Critical Success Factors (CSFs),"Traceability plays a vital role in the success of Halal Supply Chain (HSC). HSC revolve around the essential dimension of Halal Integrity (HI), whereas traceability is seemed to be medium to assure integrity. Thus, a need is felt to identify the factors which are critical to the successful implementation of traceability in Halal Supply Chain Management (HSCM). Identified Twelve Critical Success Factors (CSFs) through an extensive review of literature and opinion of experts. Further, a contextual relationship among the CSFs is developed using Total Interpretive Structure Modelling (TISM) approach and derived a model. The structural model is analyzed using Fuzzy MICMAC (Matrice d’Impacts Croises-Multipication Applique and Classment-cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) approach to identify the importance of CSFs by driving and dependence power. The primary result indicates towards; that improving the HSCM with the higher level of Halal awareness. Assuring HI will enhance the consumer satisfaction which leads to a competitive advantage for the organization. Academic researchers, industrial practitioners and Supply Chain executives can understand the complex interrelationship of CSFs by visualizing the TISM. It can help the management, lobbies and government to develop the policies regarding the implementation. Due to increase in safety incidents about food, traceability systems have gained considerable importance [77]. Also, these safety incidents have breached the trust of consumers who are concerned more about the integrity of the products. In response to growing safety and quality issues in the global supply chain of consumables, many countries have developed the laws, policies and standards [78]. Government have asked the industries to incorporate traceability systems in their supply chains to minimize the integrity issues and same for the Halal. To implement a safety and quality management system in a consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry, assuring HI may become a basis for safety policy [77]. Top management of leading manufacturing industry has realized traceability systems as a tool to comply with legislation and to gain consumer confidence in Halal products/services [79]. The summary of major finding of this research are:
‘Government Support’, ‘Awareness about Halal product’ and ‘Top Management Support’ are the major driver for implementing traceability systems in the management of supply chain with Halal credentials.
Standardization, codification & industry guidelines, knowledge/training and dedicated infrastructure, persuade top management to coordinate & collaborate with other members so that information captured through traceability systems regarding HI can be extended to the consumers.
Selection of appropriate technology is an important issue to achieve transparency and the smooth transfer of information among the supply chain actors.
All the supply chain partners must prepare themselves to implement traceability and comply with the standards and practices of traceability systems to assure HI to the consumers.
Using robust traceability systems and information management regarding HI can help in better communication with the customer and other stakeholders.
Efficient traceability system provides the HI to the consumers which leads the consumer satisfaction along with competitive advantage to the organization
Consumer Halal awareness creates the demand for a traceable Halal product which motivates the Top management and government to implement the traceability system in HSCM.
To assure that the HI of the product is maintained from farm to fork, close coordination/collaboration is required to be maintained among various supply chain partners. Also, traceability system is critically reliant on recording and retrieving of information this needs that all the supply chain members should be in sync with each other [17]. Traceability can only be effectively accomplished if built upon the global standards that enable interoperability between traceability systems across the supply chain. Standardization and codification, training and dedicated infrastructure, persuade top management to coordinate & collaborate with other members so that HI can be extended to the consumers through effective traceability.
Fundamentally, a traceability system for Halal products requires, identifying locations from where the product originates, i.e., sourcing of raw materials to processing, packaging and storage, including every agent in the supply chain till it reaches the final consumers. Selection of appropriate technology is an important issue to achieve transparency along with a smooth transfer of information among the actors in the supply chain. This depends upon various factors such as product identification, product routing, data to trace and traceability tools for effective traceability of Halal products. Through efficient communication among different supply chain actors, a suitable technology can be identified to implement robust traceability systems.
Traceability is an important practice to assure HI to the consumers [60]. Robust traceability system can reduce the risk of contamination and associated vulnerability of the Halal products. It is concluded that all the supply chain actors involved must prepare themselves to implement traceability and comply with the standards & practices of traceability systems as to assure HI to the final consumers.
Availability of adequate information to the customer regarding characteristics of the product increase the consumer confidence [80]. Using robust traceability systems information regarding HI of the product can easily be communicated to the customer and other stakeholders.
Traceability systems may minimize the risk of production and distribution of non-Halal products; may facilitate the product recall management; may fix the liability in case of HI assurance system failure. These characteristics of traceability systems may provide the competitive advantage in the market to the industry by directly connecting to the consumers.
The qualitative nature and subjectivity are the significant limitations of this study. Any biases in expert opinion may influence the result. These biases can somehow reduce the use of fuzzy triangular numbers for MICMAC analysis. The principal objective of this study is to identify factors that are critical in implementing robust traceability systems to assure HI to the consumer. An extensive review of the available literature dealing with the definitions and principles of traceability makes its focus and its key components quite instrumental in consolidating twelve CSFs of implementation of a traceability system for managing HSC.
This study focused on the effective implementation of traceability system in HSCM. A significant number of studies are reported in the literature regarding the traceability but a very few of them focus on the implementation aspects. This study identifies the CSFs to implement the traceability system in HSCM. Academic researchers, industrial practitioners and Supply Chain executives can understand the complex interrelationship of CSFs by visualizing the TISM. These CSFs are beneficial for the managers in developing the strategy to implement the traceability system. The outcome of the TISM provides the hierarchy of the CSFs to implement the traceability system in HSCM effectively. Previous studies rarely report the implementation of traceability systems in HSCM. This study is done in the context of the HSCM, which is an emerging area for the research and practice.
Expert’s opinion established the interaction among these CSFs and TISM development. The success factors which are critical in implementing traceability system are found to be awareness among consumers regarding flouting Halal practices in supply chain operations and realizing traceability as a tool to gain consumer confidence by the major market player. Further, these CSFs were classified by their driving and dependence power as obtained from fuzzy MICMAC analysis. Results obtained from this study are discussed in the light of contemporary developments and an implication of this research is presented. It is suggested that assuring HI to the consumers in an uncertain environment can be realized through a proper selection of traceability technology and effective communication with the consumers regarding information possessed by the products. ‘Government Support’, ‘Awareness about Halal product’ and ‘Top Management Support’ are the major driver for implementing traceability systems in the management of supply chain with Halal credentials.
Standardization, codification & industry guidelines, knowledge/training and dedicated infrastructure, persuade top management to coordinate & collaborate with other members so that information captured through traceability systems regarding HI can be extended to the consumers.
Selection of appropriate technology is an important issue to achieve transparency and the smooth transfer of information among the supply chain actors.
All the supply chain partners must prepare themselves to implement traceability and comply with the standards and practices of traceability systems to assure HI to the consumers.
Using robust traceability systems and information management regarding HI can help in better communication with the customer and other stakeholders.
Efficient traceability system provides the HI to the consumers which leads the consumer satisfaction along with competitive advantage to the organization",Sustainability,,
Improving Management of Green Retrofits from a Stakeholder Perspective: A Case Study in China,"Green retrofits, which improve the environment and energy efficiency of buildings, are considered a potential solution for reducing energy consumption as well as improving human health and productivity. They represent some of the riskiest, most complex, and most uncertain projects to manage. As the foundation of project management, critical success factors (critical success factors) have been emphasized by previous research. However, most studies identified and prioritized critical success factors independently of stakeholders. This differs from the reality, where the success of green retrofits is tightly interrelated to the stakeholders of projects. To improve the analysis from a stakeholder perspective, the present study proposed an innovative method based on a two-mode social network analysis to integrate CSF analysis with stakeholders. The results of this method can provide further understanding of the interactions between stakeholders and critical success factors, and the underlying relationship among critical success factors through stakeholders. A pilot study was conducted to apply the proposed method and assess the critical success factors for green retrofits in China. The five most significant critical success factors are identified in the management of green retrofit. Furthermore, the interrelations between stakeholders and critical success factors, coefficient and clusters of critical success factors are likewise discussed. This study proposes an innovative social network-based method to analyze critical success factors associated with stakeholders in energy efficiency retrofit projects. The analysis result based on the proposed method could reveal the characteristics of critical success factors through the relationship with stakeholders. Different from the classical one-mode network in previous studies, the two-mode network is adopted to model critical success factors and stakeholders as two node groups, with the degree of tightness between critical success factors and stakeholders as links in the network. To apply this theoretically innovative model, a structured procedure is provided to indicate how to identify nodes and links, build the network, and analyze it stepwise. This method can improve the effectiveness and accuracy of CSF analysis by supplementing stakeholder influence in the traditional CSF analysis. The analysis results can facilitate CSF identification and project management in energy efficiency retrofit.
A case study was conducted to analyze the critical success factors for energy efficiency retrofit projects with the proposed method. The following important findings are obtained: (1) Similarity between two critical success factors is measured by the correlation coefficient to show which factors have a similar relationship with stakeholders. (2) Although the priority rank based on degree centrality is different from that based on betweenness centrality, the five most important factors, namely, clear criteria and standard, clear government programs, clear vision, existing building evaluation and policies, and subsidies or tax reduction, are the same. (3) Factors related to the government and policy are significantly important in energy efficiency retrofit projects in China, unlike in other countries (e.g., Yang and Zou [24] indicated that the government does not play an important role in green building development in Australia). (4) Unlike the research that focused on the technical factors of retrofit [26], factors related to sociocultural and policies are more emphasized by project practitioners. (5) critical success factors are divided into four clusters; namely, building condition, benefit, construction, and policy and investment clusters. The results are based on the opinions of several professionals and need to be verified through further studies. The findings of this case study are meaningful and expected to help decision-makers involved in green building projects.
The study has four research limitations. First, the stakeholders identified through the literature review and interviews were all internal stakeholders involved in previous energy efficiency retrofit projects. External stakeholders, such as the media, were excluded. Second, this case study used classical experience-based methods to identify critical success factors and stakeholders for practical reasons. Therefore, the number of experts was limited. Although snowball sampling is time consuming and practically challenging, it is considered better than other methods in identifying a complete and accurate list. Third, the workshop was a one-off. For general results, the proposed method should be applied in more workshops so that results could be reviewed and compared to improve the understanding of critical success factors for energy efficiency retrofit. Fourth, this case study only analyzes stakeholders statically. In particular, it does not differentiate stakeholders and their influence in different phases.
Further research can focus on some potential areas and directions. Future studies can use other analysis methods besides projection, although the methods for a two-mode network are limited. These methods have advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, other two-mode network methods can be adopted to facilitate the CSF-stakeholder network analysis. Second, aside from critical success factors, other aspects of project management can be studied by this two-mode network method, such as risk-stakeholder, incentive-stakeholder, and critical success factors-process networks. Third, the proposed method can be further applied in dynamic analysis. Different relationships among stakeholders and critical success factors in different phases can be investigated and compared. Finally, more case studies should be conducted to obtain more concrete findings. The analysis results can be compared with other relevant results, such as critical success factors for energy efficiency retrofit in other countries, and for new green building construction projects. The comparative results can reveal the particular characteristics of critical success factors for energy efficiency retrofit in different backgrounds.
This study contributes to CSF analysis by developing an innovative CSF-stakeholder two-mode network method, which serves as a basis for future research in SNA-based CSF evaluation. The critical success factors in this study were identified within the context of energy efficiency retrofits in China. Therefore, they cannot be simply applied to other countries or project types. However, the research method and analytical model can be applied to other research areas.","International Journal of

Industry type and environmental policy: Industry characteristics shape the potential for policymaking success in energy and the environment,"When can complex multi-round environmental policymaking like that seen in climate be successful? An emerging branch of literature examines how sequencing matters to success and under what circumstances path dependent dynamics can lead to increasingly stringent climate and environmental policy. Here, I propose an industry typology that divides industry into four categories based on their relationship and likely response to early regulatory policy moves. I use a series of case studies that compare the application of this typology across issue areas internationally, looking comparatively at ozone and climate change policymaking; and subnationally across U.S. states in the climate change issue area. Using these case studies, I show how this model for understanding different mixes of industry type can help us understand and predict the likelihood of policy-industry feedback that leads to increasing environmental and renewable energy policy success over time, both at the international level and comparatively across national and sub-national jurisdictions. Industry types matter to policy outcomes, and to the potential for feedback
In terms of the likelihood that positive feedback will occur, industries are not created equal. The cases reviewed in this paper suggest that policy feedback in environmental policymaking will find most fertile ground in jurisdictions with (obviously) many Winner and few Loser industries, and (more interestingly) many Convertible industries. Similarly, policy that targets Winners and Convertible industries first is likely more effective in policy sequencing.

Convertible industries are high-leverage
We can make further distinctions. It is more difficult to sort out the differential impacts of developments in Winner vs. Convertible industries, since they are often targeted by the same policy. But I argue that both logic and case evidence strongly suggest that Convertible industries are high-leverage targets.

The cases of ozone (internationally) and climate (in California) policy suggest that Convertible industries allow for the rapid addition of large, mature industry groups and coalitions to support policymaking. With ozone, where Convertible industries dominated the landscape of impacted firms, changes in coalition size happened rapidly. With climate, the economy-wide impact of carbon reduction policy means a full suite of Winners, Losers, Convertible, and Management industries is impacted. It makes sense that we don't see rapid shifts in supporting and opposing coalitions as in ozone, particularly in international negotiations, where all industry interests converge. The lack of industry concentration in Convertible industries is certainly not the only challenge international climate policymaking faces, but I argue that the difference in global industry mixes is one of several key factors in explaining its difficulty.

At the national and subnational level, the precise mix of major industry groups impacted by climate policy varies substantially by jurisdiction, with different distributions of industry types. The state cases suggest that the availability of large Convertible industries, and whether policy changes those industries’ interests, is an important determinant of positive feedback.

Winners matter most to outcomes when they can scale quickly
It follows that Winners (and policies targeting them) are most likely to matter when they can grow rapidly. This is not always the case in decarbonization—utility-scale generation is capital-intensive with long lead times. Emerging industries can require time-consuming development, commercialization, and market growth to get big enough to rival entrenched Losers. Convertible industries suffer less from this problem because, even if they have to make major new investments, they still start with a large existing base of resources—significant revenues, an established bureaucracy and market networks, technological know-how, a customer base, etc. Changing the interests of an existing Convertible industry will, all else being equal, be faster than growing a new industry from scratch.

But there are instances where Winner interests emerge rapidly. Distributed generation has the potential to scale up much more quickly than utility-scale. Corporations that offer third-party agreements for rooftop solar have grown explosively over the past decade; SolarCity, one such company, founded in 2006, employed more than 15,000 employees as of 2015.59

Denmark and Colorado offer different examples. When Denmark began supporting wind power, many early windmills were built by local land-owners and small cooperatives.60 This rapidly created a new Winner group, citizen turbine owners. Similarly, Colorado's passage of an RPS created a novel business for ranchers leasing turbine siting rights.61

Three characteristics likely make for Winner industries that matter most: low capital intensity, rapid production timelines, and the ability to scale to many stakeholders quickly.

Rationale for devolving climate policy to national and sub-national levels and using a policy- rather than emissions target-focused approach
As discussed above, the ozone issue area industry mix was fairly uniform and narrow across countries, making it amenable to rapid shifts in interests even at the international level. By contrast, climate issue area at the international level brings together a saturated mix of policy types, including all of the world's most resistant Loser industries. This suggests a novel framework, complementary to other existing lines of argument, for understanding the greater progress made at the national and sub-national levels: it is easier at the national and subnational level to find jurisdictions that may have narrower and more favorable industry mixes (e.g., a higher proportion of Convertible industries). This provides an additional rationale for the desirability of international approaches that focus more on domestic policymaking, tailored to domestic contexts. The material in this paper alone cannot conclusively support this rationale for policy devolution—that would require a broader survey of the landscape of national and subnational interest mixes, an area for future research—but I argue that the logic is intuitively satisfying and the cases presented here are suggestive.

Similarly, the targets and timetables approach previously taken in international climate negotiations is inherently questionable. Weak, jurisdiction-wide emissions reduction goals suggest moderate economy-wide policies like (weak) carbon pricing and incremental efficiency improvements. These primarily affect Loser and Management industries, the two least productive policy targets. Both of these points suggest the shift in approach seen at the 2015 Paris climate negotiations may be productive, if it orients negotiations toward eliciting national-level policymaking with policy-specific commitments targeting local Winner and Convertible industries in ways appropriate to local policy landscapes.

Summing up
This paper argues that industry type matters to the potential for policy success and resulting policy feedback. Success stories tend to be those cases with one or (typically) more of the following characteristics: low starting levels of Loser industries; high potential for growth in Winner industries; presence of important Convertible industries ripe for conversion; and policy that acts effectively to convert Convertible industries and grow Winner industries.

Two areas of future research present themselves. First, I stress that my findings should be understood as complementary to existing theories of success in environmental policymaking, and further exploration of the interactions between this explanatory factor and others—both systems-level, like institutions and political context, and firm-level, like firm culture and history—would be desirable; in particular, in what circumstances this explanatory factor is most determinative relative to others. Second, I anticipate future work that delves deeper into the circumstances under which policy does or does not effectively target Convertible industries to convert them. Such future research will sharpen the practical policy lessons to be gained from this model.",Business and Politics,,
Innovative renewable energy technology projects’ success through partnership,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to uncover the importance of several variables centered around
partnership in renewable energy (RE) projects. The concept developed earlier is applied to the project
environment to identify interrelations between external and internal drivers, project partnership, resources
and project success. A framework consisting of logical chain to project success is proposed.
Design/methodology/approach – The study derived the concepts and variables of RE projects’
partnership from the academic literature. The methodology of the case study was used to gain insights in
relation to the variables in the logical chain of the proposed framework, suggesting that certain external/
internal drivers direct diverse stakeholders to a partnership.
Findings – RE technologies are not commodities and require involvement of different stakeholders, who
directly or indirectly are impacted by implementation of the RE projects. For the project to be a success, it is
critical to involve the stakeholders early in the process and induce partnership synergy, through which dynamic
capabilities and implementation mechanisms are capitalized upon as resources to achieve project success.
Originality/value – There appears to be no specific framework directly linking partnership synergy and
project success; their relationships are only indirectly inferred. Focusing on project-level activities of public
and private stakeholders the paper proposes a framework that conceptualizes relationships among external/
internal drivers, partnership, resources and project success/performance. This could be a promising future
research direction, helping technology project stakeholders maximize their returns by realizing full advantage
of collaboration and partnership. Through case study analyses of four actual innovative RE technology projects the identified
variables and interconnections between them were tested and logically conceptualized into a
RE project success framework (Figure 1).
Specifically, this study applies the concept developed earlier by the authors to the project
environment, proposing a rationale in the mentioned framework that external and internal
drivers compel various stakeholders to form partnership, through which they gain valuable
resources to achieve project success. This inquiry produced the following evidence:
 RE project success, measured by time and financial performance, is attained
through two important resources: dynamic capabilities and implementation
mechanisms. The dynamic capabilities encompass absorptive capacity,
coordination capability and collective mind, while RE implementation mechanisms
include financial, incentive and public policy. The case study proved the importance
of all these variables for project success.
 The mentioned resources are gained/accessed more effectively through partnership
and its synergy, as shown by the case studies. The interviewees unequivocally
confirmed the utmost significance of partnership not only in the cases under
consideration, but generally all RE projects. Partnerships are created through external and internal drivers that move different
stakeholders toward collaboration. Among the drivers identified through literature
review, concerns about energy security turned out to have no significance, while the
case studies point out that all other drivers (environmental, socioeconomic, financial,
cost and the need for knowledge/skills) play a crucial role in partnership formation.
The proposed framework (Figure 1) demonstrates the logical chain of interrelated
components leading to innovative RE project success, where partnership and its synergy are
the central, interlinking factor. Focusing on project-level activities of public and private
stakeholders, the framework conceptualizes relationships among external/internal drivers,
partnership, resources and project success/performance.
The findings in this research support the results of other studies on innovative
technology performance factors (Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995; Chen, 2009; Lin et al., 2006;
Xin et al., 2008), which emphasize the importance of the rate of technology adoption and
financial performance on success. In this study, the partnership synergy is seen as one of the
key variables, which influences the rate of technology adoption and potentially addresses
the questions. Chen (2009) raised in his study, that focus on major factors influencing
technology adoption, resource allocation and potential investment payoff in terms of
bottom-line financial performance.
This work also had some interesting implications in terms of the diffusion of innovation
theory: the five stages of technology diffusion introduced by Rogers (2003) – knowledge,
persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation – are present in a partnership
synergy process during the RE project implementation. In the presented cases technology
owners or NREL took a lead to provide knowledge and persuade local government, local
community members, universities and private financers to support or finance projects. Then
technology owners took the lead on the implementation and confirmation stages. Both
public and private stakeholders had or acquired through cooperation all the necessary and
required capabilities to accelerate the RE projects, and hence, the process of diffusion of RE
technologies.
It is worth mentioning that this study extended dynamic capabilities theory by exploring
dynamic capabilities of stakeholders’ partnership. The dynamic capabilities theory
introduced by Teece et al. (1997) focused more on single company resource base as a source
of competitive advantage. When it became obvious that closer integration with suppliers
and customers is becoming a major source (resource) of competitive advantage, the later
studies (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Ettlie and Pavlou, 2006; Kleinschmidt et al., 2007) extended
their research to inter-firm dynamic capabilities. This study continues this trend and
proposes to extend dynamic capabilities theory on stakeholders’ partnership relationships
for RE projects and potentially for other large-scale infrastructural projects. It is suggested
that the stakeholders’ partnership and synergy allow acquiring dynamic capabilities and
achieving fuller utilization of the existing RE implementation mechanisms. These two
resources make the RE projects financially more attractive, accelerate their completion and
help them head toward success.
The research results and the developed framework enable better understanding of
organizations’ motives to form project partnerships. However, the research does have some
limitations. Although the proposed framework helps gain valuable insights for project
managers dealing with medium and large-scale innovative RE technology projects, it is not
clear whether the same will hold for other types of projects and other industries.
Furthermore, even though the variables and logical chain to project success are uncovered,
this study does not offer specific project management tools to ensure proper functioning. along the chain or to safeguard that all variables are in place to eventually achieve project
success. These limitations could be addressed by future researches, which among other
things may also employ other research methods (such as larger scale survey) and centralized
RE project databases that were not applicable/available at the time of this study.
Despite the limitations, this study can be useful to a wide range of stakeholders and RE
project implementers/managers to pinpoint and pay special attention to the critical areas in
their project environments. First, they may consider if there are strong enough internal and
external drivers among their stakeholders (and themselves) that would allow forming
formidable partnerships in their planned RE projects. Second, they may want to assess if the
stakeholders/partners of a project possess the treats to generate the necessary dynamic
capabilities and use the implementation mechanisms described in this study and, if not,
what other stakeholders should be considered and what partners should be involved. Third,
the results of this work imply that the project managers should not only limit their focus on
the triple constraints of the “iron triangle” of project management but also look into the
anticipated and actual time and financial performance of their projects, as well as actively
capitalize on partnership-enabled dynamic capabilities and implementation mechanisms for
a higher likelihood of their projects’ success.","International Journal of Energy

"Investigating the nexus between critical success factors, despotic leadership, and success of renewable energy projects","The aim of this study to examine how critical success factors (CSFs) affect the project success (PS), directly and indirectly, using the despotic leadership (DL) as a mediating variable. Critical success factors with multiple dimensions, such as organizational factors, team factors, technical factors, and communication factors, were used in this study. In this study, we used a questionnaire survey approach. The data were collected from the project directors, project managers, functional managers, and team leaders working in the renewable energy project of Pakistan. For data analysis, we used the partial least squares structural equation modeling through SmartPLS 3.2. The outcomes indicate that team factors and communication factors have a positive and significant relationship with PS in the direct relationship. At the same time, organization factors and technical factors were insignificant in the direct relationship with PS. Moreover, to examine the mediating effects of despotic leadership, we have examined the indirect effects of critical success factors on PS. The findings of this study indicate that DL is not mediated between organizational factors and PS in the indirect relations+B93hip. However, DL negatively mediates between three factors (team, technical, and communication) of critical success factors on project success. This paper concludes that despotic leaders go beyond controlling and self-serving behaviour and are engaged in exploitative and unethical acts that can drain project resources, which reduce the success and sustainability of renewable energy projects.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,
Investment decisions in the renewable energy sector: An analysis of non-financial drivers,"Notwithstanding their many environmental, economic and social advantages, renewable energy technologies (Renewable Energy ) account for a small fraction of the world's primary energy supply. One possible cause for this limited diffusion is that private investments in the Renewable Energy  sector, although potentially appealing, remain insufficient. The lack of adequate financing is also a clear indication that our understanding of the process by which investors fund Renewable Energy  ventures is still incomplete. This paper aims to fill in this gap and to shed new light on Renewable Energy  investment decisions. Building upon behavioral finance and institutional theory, we posit that, in addition to a rational evaluation of the economics of the investment opportunities, various non-financial factors affect the decision to invest in renewables. We analyze the investment decisions of a large sample of investors, with the objective to identify the main determinants of their choices. Our results shed new light on the role of institutional and behavioral factors in determining the share of renewable energy technologies in energy portfolios, and have important implications for both investors and policy makers: they suggest that Renewable Energy  technologies still suffer from a series of biased perceptions and preconceptions that favor status quo energy production models over innovative alternatives.

Highlights
► We examine the impact of non financial factors on renewable energy investments. ► Knowledge and confidence in technological adequacy positively affect Renewable Energy  investments. ► Confidence in policy measures influences investments in PV and hydro only. ► Institutional pressure negatively affects Renewable Energy  investments. ► Ceteris paribus, experienced investors are more likely to invest in renewables. Finally, as hypothesized, the investors' knowledge of the Renewable Energy  operational context plays a significant role in determining investment decisions (β = 0.63, p < 0.01 in the Renewable Energy  share model; β = 0.23, p < 0.05 in the portfolio diversification model). It seems natural that investors with specific industry knowledge are more likely to go against the conventional wisdom and make above average investments in Renewable Energy  projects with risky returns.5

The results of the individual technology adoption model provide interesting findings too. They suggest that investments in photovoltaics are the ones most positively affected by the degree of confidence in technological effectiveness (β = 0.90, p < 0.01) and most negatively affected by the institutional pressure of external consultants (β = 0.58, p < 0.1) Also, whereas the degree of confidence in policy effectiveness does not have an influence on the Renewable Energy  share at an aggregated level, it does have an influence on investments in PV (β = 0.57, p < 0.1) and hydro (β = 0.58, p < 0.1). This is tantamount to saying that dedicated polices to support Renewable Energy  technologies are likely to foster investments in these specific technologies only.

6. Conclusions and implications for theory and practice
Renewable Energy  proponents, especially in Europe, suggest that renewable energy sources have the potential to play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel consumption in all sectors of the economy. Yet, the difficulties encountered by many countries in meeting their Kyoto emission reduction targets [92],6 as well as the resistance to setting new legally binding targets at the Copenhagen Summit, prove that exploiting this potential is far from obvious. Indeed, while the advocates of the Renewable Energy  option suggested that huge additional investments are needed to realize the Renewable Energy  potential and achieve the proposed carbon emission reduction targets, no agreement could be reached on this point [93].

Needless to say, this is particularly challenging in a context of global economic uncertainty. Although investors can play a key role in mobilizing capital to support renewable energy technologies, evidence suggests that they are often reluctant to do so. Clearly, dedicated policies can be, and have been, implemented to stimulate renewable energy investments. However, many of the efforts conducted so far have been only moderately effective because, by failing to understand the behavioral context in which investors make decisions, they have been unable to leverage some key drivers of the investment process.

In a market economy, the effectiveness of a policy is dependent upon its impact on investors' behaviors. Thus, to maximize the impact of future policies, policy makers need to get a better understanding of how investors behave and take their decisions, particularly in relation to the psychological factors that may influence their behaviors and actions.

Yet, despite this evidence, there is a surprising lack of rigorous empirical studies examining these issues in the energy literature. This paper represents one of the first attempts to fill in this gap. Drawing upon studies in behavioral finance and institutional theory, we have examined how investors' a-priori beliefs, response to institutional pressure, attitude toward radical technological innovations and knowledge of the Renewable Energy  operational context affect investments in renewable energy projects.

Our analysis has revealed that a priori beliefs on the technical adequacy of the investment opportunities play a much more important role in driving investments than the perceived effectiveness of existing policies. Implicitly, this suggests that agents consider the proven reliability of a technology as a necessary condition for investing in it, while they believe that market inefficiencies can be corrected through the adoption of appropriate policy instruments. The results have also revealed a group of investors with extremely short investment horizons, who are extremely sensitive to the institutional pressure of peers and external consultants in their investment decisions.

The paper makes a contribution to the energy policy, strategic management and behavioral finance literatures, and has some implications for managerial practice and policy making. Firstly, the incorporation of cognitive and behavioral elements is an important theoretical contribution and produces a more accurate description of the phenomena underlying investment decisions in Renewable Energy  technologies. Second, the research can advance the emerging field of sustainable investments. The few studies on this topic have focused on a restricted group of investors, namely venture capitalists. By expanding the scope to a broader set of actors operating in the sustainable energy field, this work contributes to validate and extend previous findings. Our results appear also relevant for practitioners in the sustainable energy market. A priori beliefs and limited knowledge of the broader Renewable Energy  context create additional barriers that restrain the likelihood of raising capital for clean energy investments. The analysis of these elements as opposed to more rational factors can help investors get a more balanced view of risks and opportunities in this industry.

Finally, the implications for policy makers are also clear. Investors seem to have very little faith in dedicated policy measures that directly support Renewable Energy  technologies (for instance through short lived subsidies). Conversely, they seem much more sensitive to the technical feasibility or the proven performance record of a technology as well as to institutional pressure. As a consequence, Renewable Energy  budgets should be redirected to leverage these factors, for instance by supporting R&D programs in the public and private sectors, by promoting demonstration projects, and by further disseminating information on Renewable Energy  systems within the relevant business circles and key stakeholders.

Like most research, our study is not exempt from limitations. A first limitation is that the results may be difficult to generalize because the study was restricted to a specific empirical and geographical context (Europe). It is therefore important to stress that the conclusions may not hold outside this context. We acknowledge that the focusing on a sample of European investors may introduce a bias in favor of Renewable Energy  for at least two reasons. First, in Europe the market for renewable energy has been traditionally supported by stronger incentives than, say, the United States. Second, European consumers are traditionally more sensitive to environmental concerns than their American or Asian counterparts, thereby creating a more favorable environment for Renewable Energy  investments.

A second limitation pertains to the fact that the dependent variables used in the models are self assessed. Although we have controlled the presence of CMV, the use of objective, quantitative measures of technology adoption would be necessary to further validate our findings. A third limitation is that we did not include any financial investment variables in the model. Yet, we believe that omitting these variables had little effect on the estimated impacts of the factors included in the model. Given that our sample included a relatively homogeneous set of investors who operated in the same geographical region and in the same time window, we would have hardly found enough variance in the variables describing the financial characteristics of the technologies. Finally, although we did control for some exogenous factors, the relatively limited sample size did not allow for a better differentiation among renewable energy investments. The survey included investments in a wide range of different renewable energy technologies with different degrees of innovativeness and risk. Clearly, some of the phenomena observed may be technology-dependent and require further investigation. We expect to address some of these issues in follow-up works.

Is it really all about the return on investment? Exploring private wind energy investors’ preferences,"Achieving EU climate targets requires an immense volume of investments in renewable energies, especially in the field of wind energy. Private individuals can play an essential role in raising significant parts of the necessary financial resources. This requires, however, a thorough understanding of investors' preferences. Based on choice experiments by 725 German respondents who intend to invest in wind energy in the near future, this article shows that private individuals' investment decisions are not only made with profit maximization in mind. Furthermore, this study reveals that an individual's age, asset valuation and environmental attitude significantly affect the preference for different wind energy investment attributes. The findings of this study have important implications for financial institutions and for policy, as the findings indicate that private individuals are not well informed about many aspects of wind energy investments. Individuals' investment decisions are not only made with profit maximizing in mind.
Pro-environmental individuals are more likely to invest in wind energy.
Socio-demographics affect individuals' investment preferences in wind energy. In order to increase the proportion of Renewable Energy  in Germany's energy portfolio and to achieve EU climate targets, an immense volume of investments in Renewable Energy  is required. This can only be achieved with support from retail Investors. As shown by previous studies in the field of social science, those investment decisions often necessitate tradeoffs between differing interests or the defined attributes of a specific investment [84]. Consequently, some characteristics of an investment are perceived to be more important than others. A better understanding of how (potential) investors react to such tradeoffs when making decisions about investing in wind energy can contribute important insights to both energy research and social science [85]. As our paper investigates private individuals' preferences for wind energy investments as well as the role of defined factors which influence these preferences, it makes a contribution to this field of research.

5.1. Implications
The decrease in Renewable Energy  investments in Germany in the last few years is mainly due to the sharply decreasing feed-in tariffs for Renewable Energy  power according to the EEG. In the near future, investments in wind energy will have to be economically viable without (high direct public) subsidies, as the feed-in tariffs decrease every year by1.5% in Germany. Thus, investments in wind turbines situated in Germany have to prove their economic self-sufficiency in the years to come. Under the expected future conditions, the decision of private individuals in Germany to invest in wind energy is comparable to investment decisions made by households in countries outside Germany without government subsidies for wind energy.

Additionally, potential investors in Germany also have the possibility to invest in wind turbines located outside Germany, as simulated in our CE experiment. However, the respondents clearly rejected this option showing that “this international investment horizon” might not be in the focus of potential investors in Germany so far, or they did not assess it as being attractive. In order to change this situation, financial institutions could inform their customers about the situation of Renewable Energy  in foreign markets and offer subsequently appropriate investment products.

The study shows that as expected, older people tend to avoid large investments, long investment terms and inflexible exit options. However, the older age group is of particular importance, since they own large available assets [86]. Therefore, financial institutions should put a focus on older people by aligning their investment offers specifically to this group. This applies especially to locally based banks, since a large proportion of seniors put their trust in these financial institutions. And such regionally operating or cooperative banks are also positively assessed as issuers of wind energy projects according to the results of our study.

Not only financial institutions but also the policy must contribute to the further expansion of wind power in the coming years. Since investments in wind turbines are often not perceived as attractive, policy should ensure more favorable conditions, not necessarily in the form of direct subsidies but in form of indirect subsidies such as a preferred connection of Renewable Energy  plants to the electricity grid or guaranteed feed-in tariffs for a certain time period.

It Is All about Political Incentives: Democracy and the Renewable Feed-in Tariff.,"Demand for renewable energy is booming. Scholars often attribute this success to feed-in tariffs (FITs), which mandate that energy utilities pay a premium to renewable electricity producers and guarantee grid access for them. Why have so many countries, including least-developed ones, adopted these policies? We hypothesize that democratic governments have political incentives to adopt the FIT because it improves environmental quality, promotes rural development, and distributes electricity generation profits from large utilities to independent producers. We analyze global data on FIT adoption, 1990-2012, and we find that the association between democratic regime type and FIT adoption overwhelms all other covariates. The effect is specific to the FIT and does not exist for renewable portfolio standards or public competitive bidding for renewable energy contracts. Consistent with theories of distributive politics, among democracies, institutional malapportionment in favor of rural political constituencies favors FIT adoption.  Renewable energy is a rare bright spot in today's climate policy landscape. Here we have sought to explain this trend. Since the FIT creates environmental public goods, enhances rural development, and distributes value to a large number of independent power producers, it is a particularly expedient policy instrument for democratic governments whose political survival depends on appealing to mass constituencies. To test this distributive explanation for the FIT, we analyzed data for up to bbib04307]) that developing countries are often opportunistic and uncommitted to the environmental policies in their books.",The Journal of Politics,,
Key Success Factors In Implementing Renewable Energy Programme in Malaysia ,"The high demand of energy of urban development has intensified the flow of energy through the
ecosystem. Due to the high energy prices, depletion of fossil fuels and global warming impact of fossil fuels
combustion, researchers from all over the world have been urged to develop renewable energy technology.
Most of the renewable energy technologies are still not able to compete with the conventional energy
sources. Policies and strategies need to be in placed to create renewable energy market and make the
technologies feasible. The widespread application of this technology can be enhanced by employing several
strategies namely (a) establishment of renewable technology information services, awareness and capacity
building programmes (b) development of renewable technology market enhancement, infrastructure
development and demo projects (c) improvement of policy and financial frameworks supportive for

Key Success Factors of Renewable Energy Projects Implementation in Rural Areas of Indonesia,"This paper is an exploratory study on renewable energy implementation in the rural areas of Indonesia. The study aim was to investigate the factors contributing to the sustainability of renewable energy projects in the rural areas. It mostly uses a qualitative approach. Primary data was mainly obtained from in-depth interviews conducted in site areas with the project owners, project managers, a key person in each local government, industry representatives, and the local community, including local leaders and users of renewable energy. Secondary data in the form of various official project reports was also used. The results indicated that the success of energy project implementation lay not only in good technology performance and long-term maintenance, but was also highly dependent on six key factors, namely: (1) project planning and development; (2) community participation; (3) active communication and beneficiaries; (4) availability of maintenance program, workshop and technician; (5) project management and institutionalization; (6) local government support and networks. The findings from this study provide useful insights to all stakeholders involved in the implementation of renewable energy technology for the rural areas in Indonesia. The sustainability of the renewable energy projects in this study is mainly driven by local concerns and not national policy. This means that the choice and scale of projects reflect local opportunities; in other words, mainly oriented to serve local demand. The types of renewable energy technology implemented in these areas are relatively mature technologies, such as heat from biomass (improved cook-stoves), small-scale hydro power (microhydro) as well as wind and solar photovoltaic. Daily project operation is managed by local communities in the form of cooperatives and other forms of intermediate institutions or community foundations. Moreover, community participation can be effective for a number of reasons, such as to promote shared responsibility of the renewable energy project in that area, particularly between the implementing authority (owner of the proj-ect), which is usually a government institutions or private enterprise, and the community as the users and managers of the energy projects. The study has identified the key success and influential factors in the implementation of renewable energy technologies in rural areas of Indonesia, namely (1) project planning and development; (2) community participation; (3) active communication with stakeholders and beneficiaries;  (4)  availability  of  technology maintenance scheme, workshop, and technician; (5) project management and institutionalisation; and (6) local government and other stakeholders support and networks development. In Indonesia, rural areas can be remote and difficult to reach; therefore, it is important to have appropriate supporting infrastructure for the renewable energy systems, including skills training for local technicians to help in operating and maintaining the renewable energy systems.",Journal of STI Policy and Management,,
Knowing where to go: The knowledge foundation for investments in renewable energy,"Energy policies are increasingly focused on promoting the transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Evidence-based decision-making regarding such policies needs a solid knowledge foundation. We take stock of our existing knowledge regarding the statistics and data that form the basis for research, policy and business decision-making regarding investments in renewable energy (RE). We point to several types of problems and challenges related to achieving a statistical overview of investments in the energy sector, and argue that addressing these problems is not simply a matter of intensifying existing statistical efforts and improving precision because they are caused by fundamental difficulties. We particularly emphasize the role of investors as a linkage between public policy and firm-level activity, discussing the kind of data needed to sufficiently identify investors and their activities and fulfil their particular information needs related to investing in the RE sector. This information is important not only in research and policy contexts, but also for investment behaviour. In most high-income as well as many developing countries, it has high priority to spur a transition from our current fossil-fuel-dependent energy system towards a sustainable one based primarily on renewable resources. Evidence-based decision-making moving towards this transition needs a solid knowledge foundation at various levels of aggregation. The research on the role of financial institutions in changing energy systems is relatively scarce [8], [12]. Policy is instrumental in such transitions, a fact underscored in several papers (e.g. [2], [3], [21], [47], [80]). Advancing towards establishing green, sustainable production is, however, dependent not only on political will, but also on whether empirical evidence in the area is commonly agreed upon and based upon data of a high standard. We particularly emphasise the role of investors as a link between public policy and firm-level activity, and we discuss the kind of data needed to sufficiently characterise them and fulfil their particular information needs for investing in the RE sector. Policies for unleashing the potential of green investments were not our primary area of focus, but the empirical evidence and available statistics are nevertheless important to policymaking, given that they provide the knowledge foundation for societal transition [1]. In this sense also, the data we produce and the statistical system we install are subject to value premises and choices based on societal interests [15]. Definitions and statistics do, in fact, also impact the allocation of investments [11]. In this article, we focused on a particular aspect of this discussion as we highlighted the current state of the field and remaining challenges in our measurement of RE and RE investments.

It was found that despite recent improvements, we are still not in a position to fully understand RE investments using existing statistical sources. Several areas of empirical evidence need improvement. We point to several types of flaws and challenges related to getting a statistical overview of investments in the energy sector, and argue they are not just a matter of intensifying existing statistical efforts and improving precision, but are caused by more fundamental difficulties.

Among the deficiencies in the currently available empirical evidence on RE, we first pointed out that the lack of historical, publicly available data addressing RE investment risks is one of the greatest challenges in engaging untapped capital. For example, there is an immediate need for publicly available performance data for investments in RE technologies both within and outside of equipment warranty periods. Additionally, historical data on default rates of RE firms are critical to assessing creditor risks.

A second general requirement for statistics is that we need to recognise and map the interdependent character of the energy system, which calls for indicators oriented towards throughput and interactions among agents in the system. We are not even sure how to delineate the energy sector, as its activities span across traditional industrial classifications, which in turn makes it difficult to produce adequate statistics [13]. For measurement purposes, it has been suggested that indicators of energy systems should consider what could be termed a carbon lock-in. This could be done by, for example, including the R&D budget for fossil fuels (e.g. [38]) or infrastructure ownership and energy cooperatives’ governance structures as indicators of this lock-in. Because the development and integration of new energy technologies typically takes decades, measuring should not only focus on the current state of affairs but also include forward-looking measures that reduce the high uncertainty related to the outcomes of both present actions and technological developments [14], [15].

A third and in this article most important area in which more empirical data are needed is generally investment statistics but in particular we pointed to the need to map investors in RE and which types of investments they make. A segment of much-needed information was highlighted in Section 2, ranging from the identification of investors to micro-level information on the investments. Fourth, the majority of statistics on energy production and consumption covers energy that has already been produced and consumed. Because of the intense discussions on climate change and other environmental challenges and problems, a number of scenarios for the future have been established as well. Electricity is generally characterised by limited storage possibilities; additionally, some of the renewable sources of electricity production such as wind and solar are fluctuating more than conventional sources. Therefore, statistics of such RE rarely reflect an accurate stock or potential future production. The installed capacity will, of course, reflect future production; nevertheless, more forward-looking indicators and statistics are needed. We think that new indicators should also give us a picture of how technologies are likely to evolve. Even though we are sceptical about reliance on technologies to ‘save the planet’, we do believe that predictions about technological evolution are important for the provision of statistics on energy. In turn, such statistics are important as a platform for informed decision-making, both for investors and policymakers. We recognize a slowly increasing effort of the research community to provide guidance for RE investors,9 yet conclude that there is still much work to be done.

It is unlikely that the statistical profession will ever be able to cover all parts even of our non-exhaustive wish-list above. However, although it is an ambitious requirement for future standards of data to solve all of these problems, steps towards a better statistical understanding of the (financial) dynamics of the industry require that some of these issues be addressed. We would also argue that because the energy system is undergoing changes, and because it is subject to heavy political discussions and influence, the statistical system itself needs to be dynamic and capable of adapting to the needs of users. This is done by keeping information collected in tune with what is needed from policy, investors, research.10 A balance need to be maintained here: long time-series are needed in order to benchmark over time, on the other hand statistics should be relevant, updated, and reflecting current needs. This is a classical consideration in statistics production.

"Lessons for effective renewable electricity policy from Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom","Renewable electricity development has taken different paths across countries, underpinned by different policy frameworks. Although there has been a convergence to two main mechanisms, the feed-in tariff (FIT) and the renewable portfolio standard (RPS), much debate remains focused on the effectiveness of each for meeting multiple objectives, especially energy security, CO2 reduction and economic development. Although most countries share these objectives, their choice of policy varies, explained largely by national context. Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom stand out as lead countries based on their experiences with the FIT and RPS and provide important lessons for other nations. The evidence from these three, as examined in this paper, suggests that policy design and commitment are key factors for success. Denmark and Germany have 10 years of experience with FITs and are world leaders in the field of renewable energy (Renewable Energy ) development. They are closest to meeting their Renewable Energy  targets and have been able to achieve several other objectives, especially industrial development and job creation, and in the case of Germany, CO2 emission reductions. Although other factors have been important in determining policy choice and implementation in these countries, the particular design features of the FIT allow it to address the needs of the sector. Renewable electricity development has taken different paths across countries, underpinned by different policy frameworks. There has, however, been a convergence to two main support mechanisms, the FIT and the RPS, and much debate surrounds the effectiveness of these two for achieving multiple objectives. The Danish and German experiences with the FIT and the British experience with the RPS provide important lessons for other countries that are in the process of developing policy for the Renewable Energy  sector. The evidence from these three countries suggests that, given appropriate design features, the FIT is more cost effective at getting Renewable Energy  developed. Denmark and Germany have more than 10 years’ experience with the FIT and are world leaders in the field of Renewable Energy  development. These countries are closest to meeting their Renewable Energy  penetration targets and have been able to achieve a number of other objectives, especially industrial development and job creation, and, in the case of Germany, CO2 emission reductions. Although other factors have been important in determining policy choice and implementation in these countries, the particular design features of the FIT allow it to address the needs of the sector. The Renewable Energy  industry needs, above all, adequate compensation that takes technological status into account (i.e. different rates for different technologies), access to the grid and social acceptance. The FIT in Denmark and Germany has shown that this can be provided by providing different feed-in rates, guaranteeing grid access and enabling a range of societal players to participate in the market. The RPS, on the other hand, as shown in the UK case, does not provide the same level of certainty, nor does it differentiate between technological learning curves. The result is that development has been limited to a small number of technologies by few participants. Here, too, national context is important, but policy choice and design are considered key factors in the slower pace of Renewable Energy  development in the UK.

Momentum is building for Renewable Energy  development around the world as its benefits for energy security, environmental protection and economic development are recognised. Achieving all three goals, however, requires incisive policy design and implementation. Countries on the up-swing would be well served to heed the lessons emerging from leaders such as Denmark, Germany and Britain, focusing not on the contextual differences, but rather on the policy design features that have worked for meeting a range of policy objectives.",Energy Policy,,
Local power: exploring the motivations of mayors and key success factors for local municipalities to go 100% renewable energy,"This paper investigates the decision-making processes of mayors on the municipal level in Brandenburg, Germany, to support 100% renewable energy policies as well as the respective key success factors. Three different cases and their specific settings are examined: (1) Turnow-Preilack with Germany's largest solar power plant, (2) Prenzlau, a town claiming the title 'City of Renewable Energy’ and (3) the village of Feldheim, the first energy independent settlement in Germany.

Methods
On the basis of exploratory site visits and interviews, the process of implementation of renewable energy is investigated. The methodology developed here is based on the 'theory of planned behaviour’ which helps to visualise the individual decision-making processes of key actors.

Results
Not surprisingly, many different factors influence the investigated cases. The decision-making processes must be investigated in their context that is shaped by the attitudes of mayors, the expectation of how their actions will be perceived, and the control mayors estimate to have over projects.Political resolutions Social capital Regional power suppliers Enthusiasm for technology Local image internal 'for the agent's own sake’ and external for shaping a 'sender-audience’ relationship. Economic advantages Climate change

While remaining an underdeveloped research field, the individual decision-making processes of mayors to support renewable energy projects has shown to be of great importance for the investigated cases. These cases can be seen as models for a general transition of energy supply in Germany (and Europe). By identifying a number of relevant factors influencing this individual decision-making process, this research has aimed to shed more light on how and why municipalities implement renewable energy projects. In conclusion, there are at least three topics that can be highlighted from this research. First, the overall theme regularly cited by interviewed actors as the 'good of the municipality’. Second, the key lessons for promoting renewable energy to local municipalities. Third, there were several issues that deserve further research attention.

Overall theme
In the course of this research, several drivers have been identified. It was hard to clearly distinguish between some of them. This problem can be traced back to the fact that one dominating theme was the basis for action of mayors. They ultimately focus on the 'good of the municipality’. More abstract aspects such as 'climate change’ or 'the transformation of the German power supply system’ only played a minor role. Especially climate change had a surprisingly low relevance for the interviewed actors. Mr. Sommer was the only mayor who directly addressed climate change and who linked the renewable energy projects in Prenzlau with concrete climate change projections for Brandenburg.

The 'good of the municipality’ can be understood as the utility of the inhabitants. It is defined by economic factors such as jobs, income or tax revenues that are used to finance civil services. However, this narrow definition does not encompass the relevant non-economic aspects. The strengthening of social life, the absence of a health hazard or an experience of progress can be important - and sometimes even sufficient - reasons for renewable energy and must therefore be added to the 'good of the municipality’. Renewable energy projects do not have to provide huge financial benefits to be approved by the local population. Sometimes it is sufficient for people to see that 'something positive is happening’.

Key lessons
This research suggests that initiatives promoting renewable energy to municipalities should focus on the tangible advantages for municipalities, instead of spending resources on explaining and promoting the 'fight’ against climate change. The only global factor that should be included is the depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting projections about energy prices since this directly impacts municipalities. Information should furthermore include concrete suggestions of how municipalities can deal with limiting factors such as financial constraints or a lack of know-how when investing in renewable energy. Here, regional power suppliers can play a major role. Positive examples should be further stressed to demonstrate what possible courses of action are available.

The compensation for or internalization of externalities has to be taken into account. Municipalities need to not only contribute to renewable energy but also contribute to everybody profiting from them and if necessary reject projects with unbalanced outcomes, because one negative project may destroy the chance for many other positive projects. The examples of Feldheim and Prenzlau have shown that different (indirect) ways of compensating for an obstructed view or blocked forest trails are possible. Finally, all mayors reported a great interest in the renewable energy projects by other municipalities. Initiatives that allow the exchange of experiences and knowledge between mayors and staff at the municipal level should be encouraged.

A number of relevant lessons can be learned by other (small) municipalities that plan to aim for 100% renewable energy. The most important is that instead of focussing on the obstructions that have to be overcome in energy transitions, mayors and other key actors should focus on the drivers and possibilities present in the community. Another important lesson for initiators of local energy transitions is that abstract aspects like climate change or the nationwide energy transition play a very minor role. However, positive local impacts can be observed in the investigated success cases. These impacts and their contribution to 'the good of the municipality’ should be highlighted in future transition processes.

Conclusion
The identified factors point at the key finding that the mayors first and foremost think about the 'good of their municipality’. This does not necessarily refer to economic factors but can encompass aspects such as 'strengthening community life’. More abstract factors such as climate change or contributing to the transition of the national power supply play - if at all - a minor role. Policies that aim at supporting energy transitions in similar settings should therefore shift their focus from communicating climate change mitigation to the co-benefits that ambitious renewable energy policies can bring to a community.","Energy, Sustainability and Society",,
Making Renewable Energy a Success in Bangladesh: Getting the Business Model Right,"This paper analyzes the success of the solar home system program in Bangladesh, which today
provides clean, reliable electricity to more than 16 million rural households in off-grid areas. It describes
the impact and benefits of the program; various components of the adopted technology, warranties,
and disposal aspects; and highlights the price fluctuations of its components in the global market. The
report outlines how the program’s business model was the main success factor for its immense
scalability. The final section looks at the business model of the program, its current challenges, and
other renewable energy applications. The key success factors of the IDCOL program can be summarized as follows:.

(i) IDCOL demonstrates effectiveness, ownership, and technical expertise. IDCOL
manages the program professionally with great dedication and guidance from a strong,
private sector-oriented management team and board.
(ii) Strong partnerships among IDCOL and participating organizations and shared risks
and responsibilities. Regular proactive dialogue between the partners ensures a
constant improvement and adoption of the program’s business procedures.
(iii) Participating organizations leverage their existing microfinance branch network for
sales distribution. The program uses existing NGO and/or microfinance institution
operators with an established presence and high credibility in rural Bangladesh to
operate as SHS vendors.
(iv) Reliability and maintenance services are emphasized. The program emphasizes
after-sales service. Observing the reliability of quality of these services convinced late
adopters from often poorer families to acquire a SHS.
(v) Overcome the affordability barrier. A combination of subsidies and consumer credits
(financed by development partners including ADB) from participating organizations
has helped in this endeavor by providing long-term access to finance households and
capital buy-down grants.
(vi) Sustained technical assistance from development partners. Various technical
assistance initiatives from development partners have helped IDCOL manage the rapid
rollout and quality of the program. This report suggests that the scale and success of the program was achieved by getting the
business model right. A strong partnership and ownership among IDCOL—as the creator and regulator
of the overall program—and the implementing participating organizations was the core to its
successful rollout. In addition, an existing distribution network, reliable after-sales services, and
availability of long-term microfinance loans at affordable rates and grant financing by development
partners are important factors. Going forward, one important challenge for the program is its
commercialization without compromising quality standards and ensuring consumer protection.
Regarding other renewable energy applications, such as biogas digesters and solar irrigation pumps, it is
essential to get the business model right in order to ensure scalability. ",Asian Development Bank South Asia Working Paper Series,,
Micro-Hydropower in Nepal: Analysing the Project Process to Understand Drivers that Strengthen and Weaken Sustainability,"Evaluating the sustainable operation of community-owned and community-operated renewable energy projects is complex. The development of a project often depends on the actions of diverse stakeholders, including the government, industry and communities. Throughout the project cycle, these interrelated actions impact the sustainability of the project. In this paper, the typical project cycle of a micro-hydropower plant in Nepal is used to demonstrate that key events throughout the project cycle affect a plant’s ability to operate sustainably. Through a critical analysis of the available literature, policy and project documentation and interviews with manufacturers, drivers that affect the sustainability of plants are found. Examples include weak specification of civil components during tendering, quality control issues during manufacture, poor quality of construction and trained operators leaving their position. Opportunities to minimise both the occurrence and the severity of threats to sustainability are identified. For the micro-hydropower industry in Nepal, recommendations are made for specific actions by the relevant stakeholders at appropriate moments in the project cycle. More broadly, the findings demonstrate that the complex nature of developing community energy projects requires a holistic consideration of the complete project process. Comprehensively understanding the development of sustainability drivers requires evaluation of the institutional landscape, project process and stakeholder roles. In this paper, the case study of micro-hydropower plants in Nepal has been used to show that operational drivers can be connected to events that occur within the project cycle. The responsibilities of stakeholders, their capacity to fulfil them and quality control processes were identified as key factors in determining the development of sustainability drivers. For Nepal, recommendations include integrating actions that develop financial viability earlier in the project process, ensuring that quality control processes happen at the correct time and ensuring that plant managers are correctly trained. Further work will involve conducting a detailed survey of the capability of manufacturing companies to understand the development of hydro-mechanical defects and to look for opportunities to improve reliability. For community-owned energy projects elsewhere, this works demonstrates the importance of understanding the influence that the project development process and the interaction of stakeholder responsibilities have upon project outcomes. 4.1. Responsibilities
Throughout the project process, various stakeholders have responsibilities to fulfil. Prior to commissioning, there is significant interdependence between the stakeholders’ responsibilities; specific actions are contingent on one another. Following commissioning, most responsibilities lie with the community, with only occasional support from the M/IC when technical problems occur. During implementation, the responsibilities are usually clearly defined due to the milestones imposed by the subsidy delivery mechanism [38].
When the responsibility is not clearly defined, it can be problematic. For example, the construction of civil structures from intake to forebay tank is considered to be primarily the responsibility of the community [13]. However, within tendering documentation, supervision of all civil works is an item line that M/ICs must quote for [26,27,28]. Alongside this, RSC engineers may also be expected to support the installation [13], leading to a lack of clarity in accountability and resulting in higher potential for poorly constructed civil structures. This stage of construction highlights a broader problem: it is difficult for the community (despite being project owners) to hold other stakeholders accountable.
Many of the responsibilities in the early phases of the project process result in physical outputs that are checked by institutional stakeholders. Alongside this, the actions of the community contribute to a less tangible but vital outcome: the development of collective responsibility for the MHP. Without this, weaknesses like internal conflict, lack of support in repair and irregular payment are likely to arise. Throughout the project process, certain actions are supportive to fostering the engagement of the community. At the outset, the formation of an MHFG/C aligns the interest of the community, provides representation to marginalised groups and creates a platform for community interaction with the other stakeholders [29]. The MHFG/C should ensure that all beneficiaries are active during the project, but it is also its responsibility to continue to engage the community after installation. Failure to arrange public meetings and engage beneficiaries leads to a loss of interest [44].
Monetary investment is useful in engaging individuals, and as this is expected (at an appropriate level) from all beneficiaries, it is an opportunity for all households to contribute [13]. The community responsibility of the civil construction reinforces individual commitment to the collective cause. At this stage, physical rather than monetary commitment is required, with some community members working for at least 6 months. These actions are important in developing a collective responsibility for the plant. The members of the community selected to be managers and operators have a greater responsibility. Technically, if plant operators fail to conduct regular maintenance, the reliability of the plant will suffer [25]. Economically, plant managers must ensure that tariffs are collected regularly and the plant’s income is managed. Without these actions, negative drivers can develop, and the sustainability of the plant is likely to suffer. Whilst operators and managers are paid for their work [45], a large amount of responsibility is attributed to these individuals.
4.2. Capacity
The drivers at the operational stage are often related to the stakeholders’ capacity to perform their responsibilities. The institutional framework and some stakeholders (e.g., the AEPC) remain constant from one project to another. For most of the other stakeholders, their capacity is variable. Amongst both M/ICs and RSCs, there is variation in competence, experience and manpower. At the outset, the community possess a certain capacity (e.g., financial status, cohesion, presence of managerially and technically experienced people), but the project process is likely to alter this.
From the community, several people are chosen to receive training for the roles of operator and manager. Their selection by the MHFG/C affects the reliability and financial sustainability of the plant at the operational phase. In some cases, plant operators are selected for social and economic reasons. For example, their land might be in use for the powerhouse, or they are related to someone in a position of authority [34]. In these cases, they may not possess the motivation or capacity of someone chosen through a fair selection process. Training of managers and operators is required to ensure that they are competent to fulfil their roles. For operators, there is a 22-day course [46], which teaches them how the system operates, and regular preventative and corrective maintenance procedures. This has been common for over 20 years [46] and has been shown to have a positive impact on the reliability of operational schemes [45]. However, it is common for men to move away to find employment, and if a trained operator leaves, the knowledge acquired during training (and informally during the construction and installation phases) is lost [23,45]. Evidence in the literature suggests that the training of plant managers is not as regularly practiced as operator training. For example, in [40] only 43% of managers had been trained compared to 100% of operators. This is likely to contribute to a range of the observed weaknesses, such as problems with tariff collection, low tariff setting and lack of proper accounting.
During construction, it is the community’s responsibility to collect raw material and build the civil works. The interviewed manufacturers explained that poor-quality materials are often collected and that a lack of trained skilled labour affects the precision that civil structures are built to. This results in weaknesses in both the quality of the civil structures and their ability to perform certain functions, e.g., extraction of silt in the de-silting bay [13]. The construction of the civil structures by the community is intended to reduce the overall project cost, with only supervision provided by M/ICs [26]. However, according to one interviewed M/IC, as the level of supervision is not dictated, the technicians sent to site often lack the knowledge and experience of civil elements. Alongside the M/ICs, RSCs are expected to provide ongoing support and ensure that the construction is taking place as planned. Often, RSCs do not have enough staff with the relevant experience to provide a consistent presence on-site [13]. Developing an understanding of the quantity and capacity of RSC staff would be useful in determining their ability to provide the requisite level of support.
The actions of M/ICs are largely prescribed by the subsidy process; interviewed manufacturers explained that they do what is required to receive the subsidy. New companies have entered the market, but they focus on cost reduction rather than innovation [13]. The result is that M/ICs continue to produce similar designs with the same equipment, without looking for opportunities to introduce new manufacturing processes [39] or bought-out components.
4.3. Quality Control
Quality control (QC) processes are important in ensuring that actions have been completed to a required standard. In this context, the term quality control is used to describe “any process for maintaining a desired quality of product or output” [47]. Such processes ensure that for individual projects, quality issues can be identified and that from one project to another, there is replicability. As the project funder, it is the responsibility of the AEPC to implement QC processes. Manufacturers may conduct some internal QC processes, but their actions are mostly dictated by the subsidy policy. The AEPC has produced an extensive range of guidelines that describe its expectations for how multiple phases of the project process should be completed [48,49,50]. These are comprehensive examples of good practice that when followed can motivate the creation of positive drivers. Alongside the guidelines, there are multiple QC processes, including several that are directly related to the delivery of subsidies. As the government administers both the documentation and the quality assurance, there needs to be correlation between these two areas.
Outside of the project cycle, the AEPC pre-qualifies both and M/ICs [13,51]. Pre-qualification is used to assess whether companies possess the human resources and experience required. From the detailed feasibility study (DFS) stage, the guidelines demonstrate what should be included in the report [50]. Following the submission of this report, a technical review committee (TRC) comprising interdisciplinary stakeholders assesses the report, providing an early opportunity to flag technical, social and economic issues [38].
A tendering document provides specification of all the sub-systems of an MHP. In the case of some sub-systems, such as the turbine and generator, the specification is clearly defined and can be checked [26]. For the civil structures, whilst drawings are provided, the available manpower at RSCs is a barrier to regularly checking their construction [13]. Whilst the on-paper design for the civil structures is checked by the TRC, the timing of the final check after installation means that if there is an issue, remediation may be expensive and time consuming. The final subsidy payment depends on measuring the output performance of the MHP and a visual check of the quality of the installation [52]. Often, the measurement on-site results in a value for the overall output power and not the hydro-mechanical efficiency. As such, it is difficult to compare the equipment of different manufacturers. Furthermore, the inspection of equipment only occurs on-site after it has been installed. A manufacturing or assembly defect that is observed at this stage cannot be rectified. There are standards for the manufactured equipment [8], but these are not referred to within subsidy documentation [38,53], and it was not possible to find evidence of its use for assessment elsewhere within the literature.
During the project process, there are multiple activities that consider the financial viability of the project. Initially, the submittal of a project business plan ensures that the MHFG/C considers the importance of the plant’s economic operation. In the DFS, the CC quantifies the consumer’s willingness to pay and the opportunities for productive end uses in the local area [50]. Observation of the business plan and assessment of the DFS ensure that institutional stakeholders have considered the financial viability alongside the technical feasibility. However, between the TRC review and training of the plant manager, there are no activities that consider whether the business plan has been implemented.
4.4. Local Environment
The project process dictates the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders, but many outcomes are also related to the physical and socio-economic landscape that a project develops in. The physical landscape affects the rated power available, the location and form of the sub-systems and the proximity of the plant to the beneficiaries. The socio-economic landscape dictates factors such as the wealth of beneficiaries, the opportunities for productive end uses and existing cohesion within the community. All of these factors influence both the project process and its outcomes.
At the operational phase, the site’s geographical features affect the seasonal water flow and the frequency of landslides and flooding. The DFS considers the geography [50], using an appropriate design as mitigation (e.g., storm traps to mitigate the effect of landslides), but some sites remain at greater risk or require more regular maintenance. The location of the site in relation to the community is also significant. At some MHPs, beneficiaries can be located at a 6 h walk from the powerhouse [45]. During the construction, it may be difficult to mobilise community members who are physically far away. At the operational stage, it may impact the jobs of operators and managers and the willingness of community members to pay or participate in meetings and repair works.
The socio-economic status of the local community is also relevant. In larger settlements, it is easier to connect a greater range and number of productive end uses [45], increasing the plant’s load factor and its income. Proximity to the beneficiaries may also affect tariff collection. If beneficiaries can pay at a location near to their home, they are likely to pay more regularly. A potential negative impact is that in larger settlements, a higher proportion of people depend on businesses rather than farming for their livelihoods [23]. They may be more resistant to supplying labour during the construction and for repairs when required [23]. Furthermore, in larger settlements, it may be more difficult to mobilise the community collectively. Some MHPs have very scattered beneficiaries. Often, communities located away from roads are likely to be of lower socio-economic status. They may struggle to contribute financially, with both initial and then recurring payments. This can be compounded by the distributed location of the households, which increases the difficulty in collecting tariffs.
4.5. Recommendations and Lessons Learned
In Nepal, the micro-hydropower project process demands active participation and collaboration from multiple stakeholders. The subsidy-driven process has led the AEPC to develop documentation that details standards and quality assurance, but the capacity of the institutional stakeholders is a barrier to implementing them rigorously. As a result, the quality of key technical components is often not checked until after they have been installed. The M/ICs interviewed during this study possess the experience and capacity to deliver reliable technical systems. They are capable of manufacturing equipment to the standards set by the AEPC and supervising the community in the construction of civil works. However, the current subsidy structure means many projects are given to the lowest bidder, which drives down the quality of technical elements. The community actions are effective in fostering engagement and result in the completion of MHP construction, but supporting actions are required from other stakeholders to ensure that the actions of the community result in sustainable projects. Currently, the creation of productive end uses and the financial management of plants are a particular weakness observed widely in the literature. Between different sites, the potential for productive end uses is highly variable and can be identified early in the project cycle. Based on the findings of this work, the following recommendations are made, which are considered feasible within the current project structure:
Training of plant managers is essential and should be practiced at every new installation. It should be conducted locally by RSCs to maximise the number of participants.
On behalf of the AEPC, independent consultants should use the Reference Micro Hydro Power Standard to check the adherence, quality and key dimensions of manufactured and bought-in hydro-mechanical equipment before it is dispatched to site.
Civil structures should be formally checked against the project drawings and AEPC standards by the RSC during construction and before commissioning. A subsidy payment to the M/IC for the supervision of civil works should depend upon it.
The business plan should include clearly defined actions that can be checked by the RSC. Sites with low potential for economic activity should be identified and supported. A second-stage business plan that indicates progress should be submitted when the equipment is delivered to site.
In general, for other community energy renewable energy technologies, the established project cycle in Nepal is able to provide a number of lessons. The initiation of the project by the community and its ongoing involvement are effective in fostering ownership. Finding a financial or physical contribution that is appropriate for each household is important. A subsidy-driven process provides an opportunity to introduce quality control mechanisms. However, administering these effectively requires sufficient capacity and is more effective if administered at the local level. Each project develops within a socio-economic and physical landscape that affects the project process and its outcomes. To operate sustainably, the location of some schemes means that they require greater support during the project process. Proper evaluation of the market opportunities and ongoing support to introduce productive end uses are important in ensuring that plants have high load factors and generate sufficient income. Furthermore, the responsibility of operation and maintenance usually resides with a handful of individuals; they must be properly trained and fairly paid.
In many contexts in the Global South, accurate information describing the status of installed energy projects is difficult to access. The methodology employed in this paper has sought to use field-based evidence to evaluate how project outcomes are determined by the project process. An opportunity for further work is to apply this methodology in different contexts. In countries where a national programme is used to deliver energy projects, the methodology could be applied to understand the efficacy of the project processes in delivering sustainable energy access, regardless of location or technology.",Sustainability,,
Non-technical success factors for bioenergy projects—Learning from a multiple case study in Japan,"One seemingly basic but nonetheless crucial finding is that, by and large, various non-technical success factors co-occur with good project performance. They are not limited to economic or organizational topics but cover a very broad spectrum of issues, such as public perception and stakeholder involvement. In addition, there are trade-offs between the different aspects of successful bioenergy projects. For example, while in the six cases overall success from the perspective of the project members seems to be related to the involvement of stakeholders and authorities, our results suggest that involving many actors may also act as a barrier to achieving efficiency goals, that is to meeting the budget and schedule. These trade-offs should ideally be identified and addressed in the early stages of a project.

The study also raises further research questions. These, amongst others, refer to the relative weight of non-technical factors in the success of bioenergy projects, their internal interactions and the role of the cultural context. For example, analyzing the applicability of the insights from the Japanese cases to projects in a Western context would be interesting. These questions might be addressed in a follow-up study, using the analytical framework elaborated here. It should also be complemented with further critical success factors identified in more general research on project management and organization to better understand the specific challenges of managing bioenergy projects. In such a study, a larger sample of cases should be considered, especially including commercial bioenergy projects. These ought to be analyzed with traditional multivariate statistical methods, which will contribute to a better understanding of the exact mechanisms of non-technical barriers and drivers of bioenergy projects, and will be a valuable means for successfully planning and implementing them. Given the broad implementation of bioenergy projects (commercial and publicly funded ones) both in Japan and across the globe, research on non-technical success factors is not only timely but also indispensable in ensuring the efficient spending of public and private resources in fostering the use of energy from biomass. 
Using a broad literature review, in this study we identified non-technical factors that may act as barriers to or drivers for the success of bioenergy projects. These factors were structured according to five dimensions. Of these five dimensions one refers to internal project characteristics while the others focus on the project’s embedding in its socio-technical context. Using these as a framework, six Japanese pilot projects were analyzed in order to learn which factors might have been relevant for the projects.

The first dimension is the project characteristics, a key contributor to the projects’ competitiveness and eventually to their success. According to many authors (e.g., Hillring, 2002, Roos et al., 1999), scale effects, application of mature and reliable production technologies, and markets for bioenergy products ought to increase competitiveness. Analysis of the cases reveals the absence of a clear link between project size and success. This finding is plausible, because the projects analyzed have no commercial but a research focus. In contrast, the maturity and the overall competitiveness of the products (in terms of quality and price) – in accordance with Foxon et al. (2005), for example – are in line with project success. This also seems plausible, as these are essentially proxies for the same thing; the reduction of potential disturbances in the production process, which increases a project’s plan and controllability.

The second dimension is the policy framework, an important driver for competitiveness, for example, through tax exemptions (Ulmanen et al., 2009), and can act as a barrier for the actual implementation of a project, for example, through an unstable legal framework (Foxon et al., 2005). The analysis reveals that the local policy framework, measured by the existence of local incentive schemes, their stability as well as authorities’ commitment, does not seem to be related to differences in the success of the six case studies. This finding makes sense, as they are all government research projects. Of all the factors regarding the policy framework, its stability seems to be the most relevant factor for the six cases.

The third dimension is regional integration. This issue encompasses the choice of a suitable feedstock for regional climatic conditions, the use of existing infrastructure as well as of organizational structures. The analysis of the six case studies reveals that short transportation distances and integration in existing infrastructures are associated with successful projects. This is in line with the findings of a study of a Swedish case (McCormick and Kåberger, 2007), whereas the little impact of change in farming practices is not. There, intensive collaboration between the different stakeholders may help persuade farmers to switch to new crop types and support them in the implementation.

The fourth dimension is public perception. A cooperative atmosphere (Wahlund et al., 2002) can contribute to a project’s success by providing an incentive for potential investors to engage and for local authorities to support the project. In the six case studies, a local community’s increase in acceptance of bioenergy during the project and the number of information channels used to inform the public, not the initial community acceptance of bioenergy, seem to be related to project success. This might be because the change in local inhabitants’ attitude towards bioenergy can primarily be attributed to the specific project, which is again linked to its information policy.

The fifth dimension is the involvement of stakeholders. Bioenergy projects usually require the collaboration of many people with different backgrounds, such as scientists, engineers and farmers. The thorough involvement of these stakeholders and a high-intensity of collaboration not only integrate their different knowledge but also help improve regional integration and even public perception (Stauffacher et al., 2012). In the cases analyzed, the number of involved stakeholders, their commitment, and the intensity of their collaboration all seemed to be in line with project success.

The inclusion of more issues addressing the local context of the projects and their management confirmed the significance of generic success factors such as good planning and organization (Cooke-Davies, 2002). This is of special importance for bioenergy projects, as they are often pilot projects situated in challenging and fast-changing environments. There is wide agreement in the literature that non-technical factors play a decisive role in the successful implementation of bioenergy projects. One underlying reason is that such projects require the involvement of many stakeholders, such as feedstock producers, engineers, authorities and the concerned public. We analyze the role of bioenergy-specific non-technical factors for the success of bioenergy projects. In a broad literature review we first identify potential success factors belonging to the five dimensions project characteristics, policy framework, regional integration, public perception and stakeholders. Using these factors as conceptual framework, we next analyze six Japanese pilot projects for bioenergy utilization supported by Japans Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Research Council. We apply Rough Set Analysis, a data mining method that can be used for small sample sizes to identify patterns in a dataset. We find that, by and large, non-technical factors from all five dimensions – such as the stability of the local policy framework – co-occur with project success. Furthermore, we show that there are diverging interpretations as to what success in a bioenergy project means. This requires tradeoffs between various goals, which should be identified and addressed explicitly at early stages of such a project.

On evaluating success in complex policy mixes: the case of renewable energy support schemes,"The aim of this paper is to propose the main elements of a theoretical and methodological framework for the assessment of the success of complex policy mixes, to highlight the conflicts between individual instruments and other elements within those mixes and to propose policy recommendations in order to mitigate them. Some criteria are defined, and different levels of analysis are considered. The challenges in evaluating policy packages are illustrated with the case of the coexistence between renewable energy support and emissions trading schemes. It is shown that policy mixes inherently lead to interactions between the different instruments, either in the form of conflicts or synergies. Conflicts are horizontal (i.e., between different types of instruments) and/or vertical (i.e., between different administrative levels). It is suggested that mitigating those conflicts could require administrative coordination. Relevant coordination could take place between different administrative levels and relate to different instruments or different design elements within similar instruments. However, given the trade-offs between different criteria, the role of coordination is necessarily limited. Some messages can be derived from this analysis for the assessment of the success of policy mixes more generally. 1. A broad view of elements in policy mixes is needed. Appropriate policy evaluation cannot be conducted in a narrow context. The focus should not be on the functioning of specific instruments with respect to one specific criterion, but on the functioning of the whole policy mix and the conflicts and synergies with respect to several goals and criteria in this mix. This is particularly challenging with overlapping policies. Whatmight be regarded as conflictive with respect to the interactions between two instruments might not be so problematic when a broader picture is considered, i.e.,different goals/instruments. Furthermore, it is virtually impossible to satisfy all the assessment criteria with different instruments for one or more targets. The best way to identify inherent trade-offs and conflicts between criteria is to adopt a multi criteria framework which makes those conflicts explicit. This allows policy makers to give weights to those criteria and decide on the trade-offs according to their preferences. 2. Analyses are policy-mix dependent . While a general theoretical and methodological framework for the analysis of interactions can be built, there are too many differences
between policy mixes to provide a general prescription. Thus, extrapolations to other policy mixes are necessarily limited. The analysis of ‘‘success’’ is necessarily policy mix specific. 3. The devil is in the details. Policy mixes can be assessed at a general level by identifying spaces of conflicts, complementarities and synergies between policy fields, but those interactions also depend on the type of instrument being adopted and the specific design elements of the instruments adopted within those policy fields. The choice of specific instruments and design elements within the interacting policy fields may contribute to mitigate conflicts and promote complementarities and synergies. Coordination is easier under certain instruments and design elements than under others. 4. Design of policy mixes vs. design of specific instruments. The focus should move from the design of specific instruments to the appropriate design of instrument mixes. As argued by Sovacool (2009), policy mechanisms must be implemented comprehensively, not individually. However, this is more difficult to do when responsibility for the instruments lies in different administrative/territorial levels. 5. Limited role of horizontal and vertical coordination. There is certainly a role forcoordination between targets and instruments to mitigate conflicts and to promote complementarities and synergies in policy mixes. But owing to the aforementioned trade-offs, the role of coordination is necessarily limited even at the same administrative level. It cannot achieve the highest score in conflicting criteria, and balances are unavoidable. The existence of different goals at different administrative levels complicates the role that coordination can play in successful policy mixes. Different goals may create winners and losers at different levels and, thus, lead to unacceptable distributional effects.",Policy Sci,,
ON THE SUCCESS OF POLICY STRATEGIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES IN THE EU,"6 CONCLUSIONS
The general conclusions of the analysis are: It is important for a promotional system to place a strong focus on new capacities and not mix existing and new capacities. The dissemination effectiveness of energy policy instruments depends significantly on the credibility of the system for potential investors. It must be guaranteed that the promotional strategy, regardless of which instrument is implemented, persists for a specified planning horizon. Otherwise the uncertainty for potential investors is too high and it is likely that no investments will take placeat all. With respect to the investors’ perspective, it is important to state that, at low risk (the case of FITs), the profitability expected is much lower and, hence, so are the additional costs finally paid by all customers.  With respect to the technology-specific focus in the different promotion schemes, it must be stated that this is almost impossible to apply in a TGC market (because a large share of liquidity gets lost) and it is virtually an inherent feature of the difference between TGC systems and FITs. Regarding the comparison of the different support schemes, the investigated FIT systems are effective at a relatively low producer profit. Hence a well-designed (dynamic) FIT system provides a certain dep+B50d and capacities becoming scarce, highly volatile natural gas prices and highly volatile prices for CO2-emission certificates), it is of course necessary to improve and further develop the promotion schemes for RES-E. Currently, competition exists between the different types of promotion schemes. This should lead to a future development in which the best elements of the different promotion schemes are established and the different systems then gradually converge into an optimal strategy consisting of these best features. Of course, the most important accompanying features of this process are continuity of development as well as adequate credibility for investors. Joint efforts for similar framework conditions such as, e.g. harmonised depreciation times, could be a first step
in this direction. In other words, the validity of certificates and the duration period for which a FIT is guaranteed should eventually be the same in each country. Furthermore, joint initiatives or lessons-learned clusters for the several categories of instruments could contribute to significant progress in improving the design of the promotion instruments. Such an initiative has already been started for FITs by the Spanish and
German governments (The International Feed-In Cooperation). We believe such an approach would be very important for quota-based TGC systems as well and an important step towards a more efficient and effective promotion of RES-E in the future. In recent years, a wide range of strategies has been implemented in different
EU-countries to increase the share of electricity generation from renewable energy
sources. This paper evaluates the success of different regulatory strategies. The
most important conclusions of this analysis are: (i) regardless of which strategy is
chosen, it is of overriding importance that there should be a clear focus on the
exclusive promotion of newly installed plants; (ii) a well-designed (dynamic)
feed-in tariff system ensures the fastest deployment of power plants using
Renewable Energy Sources at the lowest cost to society; (iii) promotion strategies
with low policy risks have lower profit requirements for investors and, hence,
cause lower costs to electricity customers.","

Performance Beyond Economic Growth: Alternatives from Growth-Averse Enterprises in the Global South,"Among other aims, degrowth calls for a deprioritization of economic growth as primary indicator of success. However, deprioritizing economic growth is challenging because it is the antithesis of business as we know it today. Yet, in this study, we find examples of enterprises operating in the renewable energy industry in the Global South, which deprioritize traditional economic growth as their preferred indicator of success. We interviewed 30 renewable energy enterprises (REEs) on the basis of an importance-performance analysis (IPA). Our findings confirm that conventional measures of financial performance are not universally applicable to all enterprises in the Global South. Specifically, we observed that the REEs that are least satisfied with conventional economic performance indicators possess two characteristics in common: (1) they have strong social motivations (e.g., energy access and poverty alleviation) and (2) they are averse to economic growth in the traditional sense. We draw insights from these REEs for the future of post-growth enterprise, including the importance of localness in success and performance appraisal as the Global South transitions toward degrowth. We also introduce 14 alternative performance indicators, suggested by the REEs themselves, which may help bring enterprises closer to post-growth orientation in the Global South. At this point, we return to the research question that guided our enquiry: How important are financial KPIs to REEs in the Global South? Our findings confirm that conventional measures of financial performance are most important and satisfactory to conventional growth-aspiring enterprises only. Moreover, the findings show that growth-averse enterprises prefer to be appraised using alternative, locally relevant measures of success and performance that reflect the unique features of the Global South markets and countries in which they operate. The 14 alternative measures suggested in the preceding section are the measures that are most important to growth-averse REEs in the Global South. We suggest growth-averse enterprises in the Global South offer two valuable insights into potential motivations for future post-growth enterprise.

First, instead of the current disparaging “blame” discourse, growth-averse enterprises in the Global South are encouraged by a focus instead on a more positive discourse: the potential for short-term, almost immediate, social impact. Indeed, the growth-averse enterprises appear to prioritize short-term social outcomes over those that pay off in the long term. That is, immediate social (and even financial) rewards are more important to the growth-averse REEs in this study. Thus, we infer that socially motivated, growth-averse REEs in the Global South focus on opportunities for incremental tangible social impact rather than cumulated presently intangible societal change. Socially motivated REEs must monitor whether their businesses are indeed doing good in the short term over directly manageable periods of time, given a difficult and unpredictable market environment. This focus on key social “wins” in the short term is more practical for enterprises and an important insight for degrowth. Certainly, the REEs exhibit not only the spatial and financial “sufficiency” often recommended by the degrowth corpus (Gebauer, 2018; Kunze & Becker, 2015; Sekulova et al., 2013) but also a form of temporal sufficiency, characterized by a deep satisfaction with their ability to realize immediate but tangible societal change and “do good” in the short term within the communities in which they operate. Focusing on immediate tangible impact addresses the challenge of providing experiential proximity for Global North enterprises to the ecological and socioeconomic inequities that warrant degrowth. This is an important insight for the post-growth agenda, whose success could rely on a gradual process of degrowth. We observe that much of the debate around alternatives to economic growth and alternative forms of enterprise points to the question: Will it be new enterprises or existing ones that will lead the charge toward post-growth? These findings proffer REEs as natural allies and carve a path from growth aversion to degrowth orientation for existing enterprises in the Global South. Moreover, the findings suggest that if the social need is felt strongly enough, small enterprises are capable of stepping up to the plate and are potentially willing to sacrifice their own economic growth in pursuit of greater social equity and well-being ideals. Indeed, Liesen et al. (2015)’s successful nongrowing companies and Burlingham (2016)’s Small Giants reject or are indifferent to growth in favor of greater humanistic and ecological objectives. While degrowing toward a post-growth future undoubtedly requires a long-term gradual transition, perhaps the important lesson is that small enterprises require more immediate and tangible results from their efforts if they are to remain allies to the post-growth agenda. There is therefore a need to conceptualize potential degrowth transition pathways for existing small enterprises.

Second, and crucially, the findings reemphasize the imperative “localness” of transitions toward post-growth (D’Alisa et al., 2014; Johanisova et al., 2013; Sekulova et al., 2013), by contributing the localness of success and performance appraisal as important for these transitions. As growth-averse REEs prefer to appraise their financial performance using unique locally specific criteria, we propose that local context and grassroots performance matter and merit further investigation. This is consistent with popular degrowth ideals such as autonomy and democratic ownership and equity (Deriu, 2014; Gebauer, 2018; Sekulova et al., 2013), which emphasize the involvement of all local stakeholders in decision-making, setting and achieving objectives, and performance appraisal (see last column of Table 2). Indeed, in a post-growth era, it is important to operationalize context-specific KPIs. For instance, this may mean that performance measures such as “sales level” may be willingly superseded by number and income of households served; “growth” may be interpreted as a gradual decline in the income of the households served over time; and “equity ratios” or “leverage” would reflect the currently prevailing means of attracting and acquiring investment in the Global South—that is, aid and development grants (Table 2). Indeed, where existing research emphasizes local action, community involvement and organization (D’Alisa et al., 2014; Deriu, 2014; Gebauer, 2018), we add local indicators and appraisal of enterprise performance to the degrowth corpus. Thus, we enhance extant debate around the enrichment of local, democratic involvement in degrowth activities (i.e., the process), by extending the discourse to one of locally selected and relevant appraisal of the success (i.e., the result) of degrowth activities in the Global South.","Alternatives: Global, Local, Political",,
Policy differences in the promotion of renewable energies in the EU member states,"The EU directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources (RES) has established reference targets for the share of RES electricity in each EU Member State's power supply. To reach this goal every EU country follows a different promotion strategy and some deployed instruments seem more successful in increasing the share of RES electricity than others. But we argue that there is no “natural” superiority of any instrument because the success depends on the respective framework conditions in the individual Member State on the one hand and the specific style of the used promotion models on the other. We conclude by identifying a number of success conditions for an increased use of RES: long-term planning security for investors, technology-specific remuneration for green power, strong efforts in the field of the power supply systems (grid extension, fair access to the grid, etc.) and measures to reduce local resistance against RES projects. Until now only Member States like Germany or Spain which offer a long-term (planning) security for investors with their promotion system through fixed feed-in tariffs for green electricity show still fast growing rates mostly in the field of wind energy and partly in photovoltaics too (Germany). But also other conditions are needed to stimulate a stronger use of and a switch to renewable energies: a technology-specific remuneration of green power, clear and transparent measures concerning planning and building approval, strong efforts in the area of the power supply systems (grid reinforcement or extension, fair access to the grid, etc.) and last but not least steps to reduce local resistance against RES projects, as requirements to developers for regional added value like in Spain or a strong financial participation of the local population in wind plants like in Denmark or Germany.

From a perspective point of view one can notice that a general change in the use of renewable energies is starting to take place: from a decentralised to a more centralised application. This reduces prices in some cases and fits the dominant belief system of the energy industry. Co-combustion of biomass and offshore-wind energy is compatible with the large-scale system. Offshore-wind energy is a realistic perspective for all countries in the EU with the exception of Austria and Luxembourg which have no coasts. There are experiences in co-combustion of biomass in Austria and Ireland, for example. In the Netherlands there is an agreement between the government and producers, in which coal plants have to be as efficient as gas plants by 2010. Therefore, the producers are forced to co-combust biomass. But one should not only concentrate on these large-scale options which are supported from the top-down. Wind energy development in Germany and Denmark showed that bottom-up initiatives may be a crucial success condition. Other renewables like photovoltaics will not fit in the large-scale system. Therefore, it is also important that their development is supported from the bottom-up in the future. But as a press release, published by the European Renewable Energy Federation (EREF) and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) on 30 October 2002, warned that one of the most important targets of the EU-Directive for the promotion of RES electricity—the increase of the share of RES electricity to 22% in 2010—will be missed by 5–7%, both kind of measures, centralised applications as well as more bottom-up initiatives, has to be pursued. One way to reach this goal, beside the endless debates about the best promotion instrument, could be a stronger reduction of the still huge subsidies for fossil and nuclear energy (1999: $ 300 billion at global level, see: Scheer 1999, 153pp.) and a redirection of a part of them for a stronger financial promotion of renewable energies.

Pre- and Post-Adoption Beliefs about the Diffusion and Continuation of Biogas-Based Cooking Fuel Technology in Pakistan,"A high level of acceptance and adoption is necessary to facilitate the widespread utilization of renewable energy technologies for cooking, as such utilization is essential for displacing the population’s massive dependence on fossil fuels and solid biomass. Economic and demographic aspects have been the focus of recent literature in exploring the adoption phenomenon of biogas technology. However, literature to date has given little attention to the behavioral factors and the perceptions of the end-users. Our study does not only include behavioral factors, but it employs a hybrid model to explore the continued attentions of users based on their post-adoption beliefs and performance expectations. Using a survey conducted in Pakistan in 2017, the study conducts a multivariate analysis through structural equation modeling to measure the effect of pre- and post-adoption beliefs and expectation on adoption and the continuing intention of households towards biogas technology. Results show that the acceptance of the households towards biogas technology is highly influenced by their perceptions on the benefits, as well as their trust in the technology. The perceived cost and risk attached to the technology are found to be negatively correlated with the acceptance. Households’ intentions to continue the use of biogas technology is highly influenced by the satisfaction level of the users of biogas technology. With the integrated model of adoption and continuation, the study illustrates the dynamic process in obtaining a deeper understanding of a user’s behavior to better formulate the policies for increasing the rate of technology adoption. The study developed an integrated model for simultaneously analyzing the adoption and continuation of biogas cooking fuel technology in the context of rural Pakistan. The empirical findings confirm the validity of the proposed analytical model. For the adoption of the technology, the study analyzed users’ positive and negative perceptions on biogas technology against the subjective beliefs of the households. Users’ pre-adoption beliefs about benefits and cost determine the adoption of the technology. The monetary aspects of cost savings, investment, operating cost maintenance cost, as well as the non-monetary aspects of comfort, saved time, compatibility, and convenience, are crucial in the studied adoption process. Moreover, obstacles are as important as the facilitating factors in this adoption process. It is evident that the high cost and risks involved in the uptake of biogas technology slow down the process of adoption [74,75]. One way for addressing this issue is to provide more training to users and thus minimize the risk of incorrect operation and improve the performance and operational safety of the biogas digesters. To reduce financial risk, easy loan schemes and financial support from private institutions can make the initial investment manageable for the users with a limited budget. Evidence suggests that addressing non-monetary aspects explicitly facilitates adoption and ensures continued use. This can be improved by focusing on the comfort of operation, highlighting the timesaving features of biogas digesters, and offering follow-up services for greater convenience.
Post-adoption perceptions concerning the usefulness of the technology determine the satisfaction level of the users, which is an important determinant in users’ intention to continue using biogas technology. For a sustainable continuation of biogas technology, the technology’s usefulness when compared to traditional cooking fuel technologies enhances the probability of users continuing the usage after initial adoption. The satisfaction of users and their willingness to continue using the technology will likely increase if biogas technology meets their efficiency expectations better than other traditional cooking fuels. One suggestion is to have proactive marketing and communication that focuses on the usefulness and efficiency of biogas technology without ignoring the limitations. Raising awareness and adapting beliefs to the realities of biogas technology is necessary for enhancing the adoption and acceptance of the technology.
The study contributes to the theory and model development by combining adoption and continuation intention in one model for analysis based on pre- and post-adoption expectations and performance perceptions. The model is suitable for describing the adoption and continuation processes of other technologies in various contexts. The study also contributes to the literature on renewable energy development, specifically in South Asian emerging economies where more effort is desirable for developing societal and local conditions in rural areas that are conducive for the adoption of these innovative technologies. From the managerial perspective, the study gives an indication for policymakers and manufacturers to think beyond the general economic conditions and includes the expectations and non-monetary aspects of the end-users in their agendas and policy formulations. Moreover, the proven relationship between satisfaction and intention to continue using biogas technology gives an indication to the service providers for continuing their investments in maintaining or increasing the satisfaction level of the end-users, thus securing the long-term use of the technology. Service providers should devise strategies for enhancing the satisfaction level among existing users by meeting their specific expectations. This will not only retain the existing users, but these satisfied customers can provide an effective conduit to bring in new users via word of mouth. Perceptions of the benefits of technology are subjective expectations about the positive implications of using technology. If users believe a technology/innovation to be more efficient and effective, the probability of adoption of that technology/innovation will likely increase [33]. Benefits from biogas technology are both tangible and intangible [40]. Tangible or direct benefits include a reduction in fuel cost and the provision of organic fertilizer; intangible benefits consist of improved health due to less smoke, a cleaner home due to an absence of residue, a greater convenience of cooking food with less time and effort, and fewer hazardous effects on the environment [41]. These positive perceptions about biogas technology may motivate households to adopt the technology.
Another potential driver in this confirmation/adoption process is the perceptions about the ease to use the technology. This refers to the belief that a particular technology requires less effort to learn and use and is relatively simple to understand [42]. This cognitional factor implies that there is an increased chance of users adopting a technology which they perceive as user-friendly compared to one they perceive as less user-friendly. Perception is an important construct in the technology adoption model (TAM); however, it is argued that the perception of the ease to use technology has higher importance at the early stage of adoption and that this importance tends to diminish in later stages [43]. The reason is that over time, users become familiar with the technology/innovation, and they learn to operate or use it in later stages. Another concern that potential users of new technology may have is perceived trust. Before the usage and experience of new technology, trust plays an important role in forming people’s beliefs. Specifically, trust is defined as a cognitive state of positive anticipation that affects the user’s perceptions to adopt the technology [44]. Several studies found that trust generates from the surrounding atmosphere and comes from other users in society. A strong positive association between perceived trust and adoption of technology is found in numerous studies for various technologies [45,46,47]. Based on these above drivers, we hypothesize the following:",Energies,,
Public Willingness to Pay and Policy Preferences for Tidal Energy Research and Development: A Study of Households in Washington State,"Puget Sound in Washington State (WA) has significant tidal energy resources, but the industry is at a nascent stage of development. At this stage, the availability of research and development (R&D) funding plays a critical role in the success or failure of renewable energy schemes. However, information about public interest in developing marine renewable energy technology, including tidal energy technology, in WA and the U.S. has been limited. Responses to a dichotomous choice referendum question on a mail survey sent to a representative sample of WA households were used to estimate residents' Willingness to Pay (WTP) for tidal energy R&D. Public preferences for policies to support tidal energy R&D were also assessed. WA households are WTP between $29M and $127M annually for tidal energy R&D, indicating public preference for an increase in government spending on tidal energy R&D over current levels. Public perceptions of potential social, environmental, and economic risks and benefits of developing tidal energy emerged as highly significant predictors of WTP. Recently, private investors and governments pledged unprecedented financial and political support for renewable energy R&D in conjunction with the Paris Agreement. This is likely to create push for both the development of new energy technologies and also demand for an acceleration of bringing these technologies to market on a global level. Studies such as the analysis presented here help ensure that funding is directed in a way that aligns with societal preferences along with market acceleration objectives. The tidal energy industry is in a nascent stage and as a result marine renwable energy developers are increasingly using internationalization as an approach to overcome challenges and move the industry forward (Lovdal and Neumann, 2011). Therefore, the implications that this study has for funding tidal energy R&D in the state of Washington are important for fostering the industry on an international level. Results from this study demonstrate that for the relatively early-stage tidal energy technology, providing R&D funding from both the private sector and federal government through a TIS approach would likely be popular with the public. This reveals that the development of the tidal energy industry in Washington may proceed in a different direction from the UK, where funding was provided through a Feed-in-Tariff approach.

When median estimates from the raw dataset are projected to the state level, we estimate that WA state households would be willing to pay between $29M and $127M annually for tidal energy R&D. In comparison, the entire marine renwable energy R&D budget for the U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Program in fiscal year 2015 was $41M (U.S. Department of Energy, 2016). Furthermore, the two-year budget for the state of WA's Clean Energy Fund, which is the main source of state-level renewable energy R&D fund, is $76M for a two-year time period from 2015 to 2017. The state has spent $0.6M on marine renwable energy R&D to date (WA Department of Commerce, 2015b). This indicates that WA state residents have in interest in developing tidal energy and would be in favor of a significant increase in tidal energy R&D investments over current public spending levels.

Methodologically, we found that that perceptions of risks and benefits are strong predictors of WTP for tidal energy. Interdisciplinary collaboration on the creation of these indices helped to capture a robust picture of possible risks and benefits. The discrepancy between public WTP and government provision of tidal energy R&D funding can likely be explained by the idea that individuals associate non-market benefits with investing in tidal energy R&D. This is supported by the evidence that the non-market benefits of developing tidal energy, such as reduction of carbon emissions, having a local source of energy that will benefit current and future generations, and increasing local knowledge of energy issues were included in environmental and social benefit indices. In addition, these non-market benefits are not captured in metrics commonly used by the government to evaluate the cost of tidal energy projects, such as the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Furthermore, asking about WTP for tidal energy R&D as a share among of other types of renewable energy R&D likely helped to pinpoint a more precise estimate of WTP for tidal energy R&D and this technique could be further developed and empirically tested in future WTP studies for renewable energy technology.

Empirically, it is important to note that one limitation of this study is that WTP for tidal energy R&D is related to an original function of WTP for renewable energy R&D that produced inconsistent estimates of WTP; therefore we believe that estimates on the conservative end of this range are more appropriate for use in the policy process. Other limitations include the fact that we were unable to weight our data to be demographically representative of residents in the state of WA and the study is limited in scope in that it only focuses on the state of Washington.

Relevant areas of future research include expanding studies about policy preferences to technology developers and other relevant actors involved in the tidal energy R&D process. Survey respondents preferred that the federal government be primarily responsible for funding tidal energy R&D, so expanding this study to a representative sample of U.S. residents may be appropriate. Future WTP studies could benefit from a theoretical grounding psychology and the application of specific psychological theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior. Future questions of interest include understanding why the Washington state public stated a preference for funding tidal energy over other types of marine renwable energy such as wave and offshore wind energy and understanding if the public prefers certain types of tidal energy technology.",Ecological Economics,,
Regulatory Stringency and Policy Drivers: A Reassessment of Renewable Portfolio Standards,"Renewable energy policy has far-reaching implications for national and international economic, environmental, and political sustainability, but thus far within the United States it has been almost entirely the province of state governments. This article examines the factors motivating state-level policymakers to adopt different forms of a renewable portfolio standard ( RPS), highlighting the distinction between degrees of policy stringency, ranging from entirely voluntary participation to rigorous and strictly enforced targets. In the process we introduce a new metric for assessing stringency, more precise and reliable than the various proxies used previously, and analyze its relationship to drivers of policy adoption. We find that policies of different stringencies are motivated by systematically different underlying factors. State-level citizen political ideology is a significant predictor of RPS policy adoption, particularly for 'voluntary' and 'weak' policy designs. 'Strong' policy designs, on the other hand, are best predicted by ideology at the government level, i.e., the degree of institutional liberalism. These findings may inform current implementation and program evaluation efforts, and potentially point the way toward more effective policy choices if and when an RPS moves forward on the national policy agenda, while the stringency metric central to this analysis can be of use to other policy scholars concerned with topics both within and beyond the realm of energy policy. The effort involved in determining and applying a metric for RPS policy stringency appears to be fruitful, clarifying ambiguities in earlier work on this popular
policy instrument. The drivers of voluntary, weak, and strong RPS policies are distinct from one another. Ideological factors stand out as highly important drivers of policy adoption, with citizen ideology the most significant driver of voluntary and weak policy adoption, and government ideology the most significant driver of strong policy adoption. The RPS is by no means the only policy instrument available to pursue energy or climate objectives such as electricity diversification, GHG abatement, or energy security, but its rapid spread provides critical insight into the circumstances under which states make policy decisions, and points the way toward multiple avenues of future research. For policymakers and advocates, it is valuable to know the circumstances most conducive to adoption of a particular kind of policy design. In scholarly terms, the foundation is laid for more nuanced inquiries into the mechanisms of diffusion for policy innovationsMeanwhile, the approach we introduce for measuring and comparing policy stringency may help other analysts formulate more systematic metrics for similar situations. This approach avoids many problems of previous measures (e.g., compression into binaries or subjective weighting), while offering greater precision, and may thereby contribute analytical value beyond the realm of energy policy. Many kinds of policies cannot be evaluated fully except in the long term, after all, yet still present a wide range of variations to scholars and practitioners that must operate in the moment; and in such situations a comparable construct could readily be useful.",Policy Study Journal,,
Renewable electricity in Sweden: an analysis of policy and regulations,"This study aims to analyse the developments in renewable energy policy making in Sweden. It assesses the energy policy context, changes in the choice of policy instruments, and provides explanations behind policy successes and failures. Swedish renewable energy policy has been developing in a context of uncertainty around nuclear issues. While there has been made a political decision to replace nuclear power with renewables, there is a lack of consensus about the pace of phasing out nuclear power due to perceived negative impacts on industrial competitiveness. Such uncertainty had an effect in the formulation of renewable energy policy. Biomass and wind power are the main options for renewable electricity production. Throughout 1990s, the combined effect of different policy instruments has stimulated the growth of these two renewable sources. Yet, both biomass and wind power are still a minor contributor in the total electricity generation. Lack of strong government commitment due to uncertainty around nuclear issues is a crucial factor. Short-term subsidies have been preferred rather than open-ended subsidy mechanisms, causing intervals without subsidies and interruption to development. Other factors are such as lack of incentives from the major electricity companies and administrative obstacles. The taxation system has been successful in fostering an expansion of biomass for heating but hindered a similar development in the electricity sector. The quota system adopted in 2003 is expected to create high demand on biomass but does not favour wind power. The renewable energy aims are unlikely to be changed. Yet, the future development of renewable energy policies especially for high-cost technologies will again depend strongly on nuclear policies, which are still unstable and might affect the pace of renewable energy development. Swedish renewable energy policy has been developing and evolving in a context of debate around nuclear issues—the pace of phasing out nuclear power. The debate, no doubt, had an effect in the formulation of legal attitudes to renewable energy, which in turn fashioned legal techniques that were used in the formulation of renewable energy policy and regulations. On the one hand, there has made a political decision to decommission all nuclear reactors and it is this replacement of nuclear power that was the rationale behind the renewable energy policy programs. On the other hand, there are concerns about the negative impacts on industrial competitiveness and thus there is still a basic lack of national consensus concerning the pace and timeframe of phasing out nuclear power.

Such a dilemma resulted in a lack of strong government commitment to developing renewable energy sources, which is reflected in the short-term nature of the subsidy programs for the renewable energy sources. The subsidy programs were limited in amount and time, causing intervals without subsidies and interruption to the development of renewable sources. Thus biomass and wind power, despite of the growth in the past decade, are still a minor contributor in the total Swedish electricity generation.

The successful Swedish experience in promoting biomass use in heating production shows that using the tax instrument is a cost-efficient policy and measure, which can be used to internalise the cost of those external effects and thus promote the use of renewable energy sources. However, environmental taxation on fossil fuels has been directed mainly at the heat fuel markets. Power generation is exempt from carbon dioxide tax. The result was a large scale, surprisingly successful increase in biofuel use in heating sector, but only a slight increase of biofuel use in electricity generation.

The quota system in the form of tradable green certificates, effective as of 2003, is expected to create a firm demand for bio-fuels for electricity production. It is expected to result in more biomass-based CHP as this system is designed to promote investments in the least-cost renewable electricity sources. Thus, the system is not particularly well suited to promoting new, yet uncompetitive, technologies such as wind power. The development of wind power might be temporarily slowed down. Targeted support for wind power has been introduced to compensate for this effect. However they are short-term measures and will be phased out in a few years. Long-term government commitment and support are therefore necessary for the further development of wind power.24

There are also legislative and administrative obstacles to the development of renewable energy. As witnessed in the case of wind power development, weak governmental initiative resulted in the slow reaction of the local governments that are in charge of issuing the permit for wind power installation. Double regulation has worsened the situation. This is not specific to wind power, but also affects other activities which require a permit according to the regulation, including biofuelled CHP.

Other barriers are such as subsidies of conventional non-renewable energy, cheap and sufficient electricity from nuclear and hydropower and a lack of incentives from the major electricity companies to develop renewable energy sources. The major electricity companies all have a significant share of nuclear capacity and thus their main interests are in conflict with the rationale and objective of the renewable energy programs.

In addition to the governmental policies and regulations, there are also other factors affecting the development of renewable sources. NGO activities have been important driving force in promoting the renewable energy sources in Sweden. The degree of public opinion on environment changes with the economic cycles. When the economy is regarded as important, the importance of environmental issue decreases, and vice versa.

The renewable energy aims are unlikely to be changed. The green certificate system may become a strong stimulation for the least-cost renewable electricity sources such as biomass. However, the future development of renewable energy policies for the high-cost technologies such as wind and solar energy resources are difficult to predict, and will again depend strongly on nuclear policies, which are still unstable and might affect the pace of renewable energy development.",Energy Policy,,
Renewable energies and the poor: niche or nexus?,"Renewable energies are considered as an essential element of any strategy for sustainable energy development. The poor in the developing world without access to modern energies are regarded as a major market for renewable energies. This short paper attempts to analyse whether such a niche is backed by any economic logic and whether renewable energy and the poor nexus could be a strategy for success. The paper suggests that contrary to the common belief, the economic logic behind the niche is unsound and that the nexus is not a recipe for success. The arguments presented above provide a plausible explanation of the difficult situation in which the poor and the renewable energies find them. Renewable and modern energies compete with energies that involve no money transactions. Providing modern energies almost freely does not make commercial sense and does not motivate private entrepreneurs. Skills for alternative form of market organisation do not exist. There appears to be no niche market for renewable energies for meeting energy demand of the poor and the poor-renewable energy nexus is not a recipe for success.

Additionally, the issue of path dependence is of great importance for the poor. Choice of one option automatically removes alternative options, more so for the poor because of limited affordability. Extra care should be taken in introducing strong path dependence in poor countries through deceptive and distorted incentive mechanisms that could prove costly in the long run and lead to stranded cost problems. Many renewable technologies have not yet reached maturity and cost reductions, innovative applications and other changes cannot be ruled out. The poor being the most vulnerable segment of the society should not be made targets of such technological experimentation, unless of course such trials involve no money outgoes for the poor individually or as a nation. However, the present experience shows that the poor are the main targets and perhaps they are not economically better off with these technologies unless they get such technologies free of charge.",Energy Policy,,
Renewable energies in the EU-Accession States,"The aim of this article is to discuss obstacles and success conditions for renewable energy sources in the EU-Accession States and to compare them with the framework in the EU-15. Besides the ten states which will join the EU in 2004, Bulgaria and Romania which will probably join in 2007 as well as Turkey are analysed. Most of these countries have had a century-long tradition in the utilisation of RES, primarily in biomass and hydropower. However, the communist regimes were convinced of the superiority of large-scale systems and converted the energy sectors into centralised units. Due to this dominating belief system more decentralised applications such as installations using renewable energies had to close.

One crucial driving force for future renewable energy development in the Accession States comes from the stipulations set by the EU. The EU-Directive on the promotion of electricity produced from RES gives the new EU-members targets for their RES-development until 2010. Due to the Directive many Accession States have already begun to pay more attention to the topic and to introduce more systematic policies. Six of the Accession States have introduced minimum tariffs which were one of the main success conditions (besides a stable and sound investment programme as well as favourable background conditions) in the leading wind energy countries Germany and Spain. Beside the external pressure by the EU and other international obligations other driving forces such as the path dependencies in the national energy policies (degree of coal, oil and gas exploitation, nuclear power use, import dependency), the political support schemes for renewable energies, possibilities of obtaining external financial support and the cognitive environment are discussed. Finally similarities and differences between EU-15 and Accession States are worked out. The further evolution of RES in the EU-15 and its Accession States will most likely depend on a combination of prices and political support. Putting an end to price distortion by removing subsidies for conventional fossil and nuclear energies and internalising external costs would be a decisive step for a better competitiveness of RES. Ratification and progressive tightening of climate change agreements in later commitment periods (after 2012) will also help. From about 2005 onwards, due to the report on the success of the different RES promotion systems currently in use in the EU, as provided in the EU-Directive 2001/77/EC, a Community framework on support schemes for RES electricity may be proposed which in the medium and long-term would further bring down RES prices. Also, the EU has an important self-interest at stake in the development of renewable energy sources throughout the world—not only as the biggest exporter of renewable energy technology, but if they do not favour RES they will also face intense competition for oil and gas resources from rapidly industrialising states in Asia and Latin America (European Commission, 2000). As non-OPEC reserves are expected to peak during the next decade or two, the resulting shift in power in favour of OPEC is likely to result in high oil prices. Such a price increase could on the one hand benefit nuclear and coal, but on the other hand could promote RES even more (Bechberger and Reiche, 2003; Lauber, 2002) ",Energy Policy,,
Renewable energy cooperatives: main features and success factors in collectively implementing energy transition,"— Cooperatives for renewable energy are examples of
proactive citizen initiatives aiming for implementation of
alternative energy supply models. These initiatives not only result
in higher shares of renewable energy, but at the same time
represent alternative business models with the citizen as main
actor and beneficiary, and in consequence challenge the
predominant power of big companies active in the energy sector.
This publication provides an overview on main characteristics of
renewable energy cooperatives. Furthermore, it explores means
to overcome key challenges and to implement such projects
successfully. This is achieved by exemplifying the main factors in
two selected contexts: (1) Scoop.eu, the federation of groups
and cooperatives of citizens for renewable energy in Europe, and
(2) bioenergy villages, which are among the best known examples
of cooperative-based renewable energy systems. Communitybased renewable energy projects clearly benefit from networks
and in particular from facilitated exchange of experience. Renewable energy initiatives reduce the share of fossilbased energy and in consequence reduce emission of
greenhouse gases. Community-based projects achieve active
participation of the citizen, a vital element in sustainable
development, and therefore have particularly high
attractiveness (Kusch and Beggio, 2015). Citizens engaged in
renewable energy cooperatives foster transition to more
sustainable energy systems, based on utilisation of renewable
resources and integration of decentralised energy conversion
facilities as a viable option.
Cooperatives are not only relevant as business model for
financial citizen participation within the energy sector, but for
example in Germany constitute the organisational form that has
become the most relevant regarding active participation in local
energy policy (Yildiz et al., 2015).
Shining examples, which are successful projects, hold the
potential to inspire and encourage initiation and
implementation of new projects. Such projects do not need to
be extraordinary, successful application in an average
environment can be particularly beneficial in encouraging
uptake by other communities. Bioenergy villages are among
the best known examples of communities breaking dependency
from existing energy supply markets and implementing their
own systems. Potential replication throughout Europe and
beyond certainly depends on favourable frameworks and
suitable policies, but in particular on the decision of a
community and individuals to get involved.
The aim of this study was to elaborate a practice-evidenced
understanding of main factors which contribute to the success
of community-based renewable energy initiatives. More
detailed research, and a more structured methodological
approach, would be necessary to advance towards a precise
assessment of possible interplays of various factors. However,
the study reveals that networks which foster exchange of
information and experience, promote education and exchange
of knowledge, and help to overcome financial and banking
barriers are clearly highly valuable to support the creation of
new and successful cooperatives.B101",Multidisciplinary Conference,,
"Renewable energy in Turkey: Great potential, low but increasing utilization, and an empirical analysis on renewable energy-growth nexus","Concerns about the exhaustion of fossil energy sources, energy security problems, and increasing environmental problems have led policy makers to pay greater attention to renewable energy sources all over the world. Additionally, high current account deficits stemming from energy import dependency make substitution of fossil energy with renewable energy a necessity for Turkey. Although Turkey has a great potential in terms of renewable energy, it has not begun to utilize this great potential until recent years. However, Turkey has many motives to utilize renewable energy further.

This paper aims to investigate whether renewable energy consumption raises GDP in Turkey. For this purpose, the paper uses data spanning the period 1990–2015 and employs cointegration and causality tests which can present efficient output in small samples. The findings indicate that GDP is not related to renewable energy consumption and there is no causality between GDP and renewable energy consumption in Turkey. In conclusion, the paper argues that these findings may stem from the low share of renewable energy in total energy and Turkey needs to utilize renewable energy sources further to (i) meet energy needs for economic activities, (ii) mitigate environmental problems, and (iii) reduce energy import dependency and current account imbalances. Considering worrisome concerns about climate change along with economic and politic problems arising from the use of fossil fuels, a renewable energy focused approach has stood out to handle the dual pressure of climate change and increasing consumption levels of energy (Hansen and Skinner, 2005). Turkey has a significant potential for the production and deployment of most of the renewable energy sources. However, when one observes energy data for Turkey, he/she can observe that the share of renewable energy in total energy is still very low compared to fossil energy even though the share of renewable energy in electricity production has increased in Turkey in the last years.

Policy makers around the world expect renewable energy to (i) meet energy needs for sustainable development, (ii) decrease environmental problems, such as air pollution, global warming, and climate change, stemming from the use of fossil sources, and (iii) provide energy security. Policy makers in Turkey have two more expectations regarding renewable energy. Accordingly, substitution of fossil energy with renewable energy can decrease energy import dependency and improve current account balance of Turkey.

This paper tests whether renewable energy can meet the first expectation denoted above. Put differently, this paper examines the relationships between renewable energy consumption and GDP in Turkey using data over the period 1990–2015 within a Cobb-Douglas production function framework including a democracy index. The paper also adds fossil energy consumption to the empirical model to make a comparative analysis. It employs time series techniques which can present efficient output in small samples. The findings show the growth hypothesis dominates for the case of fossil energy consumption while the neutrality hypothesis prevails for the case of renewable energy consumption. Then, the findings of the paper majorly conform to those of other papers which investigate the renewable energy consumption-GDP nexus for Turkey.

In the energy economics literature, some papers try to explain the possible reasons of the neutrality hypothesis. For instance, Ghali and El-Sakka (2004) remark that when an economy grows, its production structure is likely to shift from industry sector to information and service sectors, which are not energy intensive sectors. Besides, Apergis and Payne (2009), Belloumi (2009), and Menegaki (2011) reveal similar arguments about the dominance of the neutrality hypothesis for renewable energy. Accordingly, while Apergis and Payne (2009) and Belloumi (2009) assert that the neutrality hypothesis can be valid when renewable energy is a little component of GDP, Menegaki (2011) specifies that the neutrality hypothesis can prevail due to early stages of development of renewable energy and thus insufficient utilization of renewable energy sources. According to the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (2018) data, the share of industrial sector in GDP has increased during 1998–2017 in Turkey (from 19% to 21.6%). Therefore, Turkey's production structure did not change too much over the last two decades. As was presented in Section 2, in order to utilize great potential in terms of renewable energy, the Turkish governments (i) made some significant legislative arrangements for renewable energy, (ii) implemented many policies towards renewable energy, and (iii) made energy sector more competitive. As a result, the share of renewable energy in total energy has begun to increase in recent years. However, it still low compared to fossil energy. Therefore, in accordance with the views of Apergis and Payne (2009), Belloumi (2009), and Menegaki (2011), this paper argues that the low share of renewable energy may lead to the validity of the neutrality hypothesis for renewable energy in Turkey. This paper therefore contends that renewable energy can satisfy expectations regarding economic growth if the share of renewable energy increases in Turkey. Moreover, it advocates that renewable energy can (i) mitigate environmental problems, (ii) contribute to energy security, (iii) decrease energy import dependency, and (iv) improve current account balance. This paper also argues that production of more energy from renewable sources can improve allocation of resources in Turkey. Accordingly, if current account balance of Turkey can be improved through more utilization of renewable energy sources, then more resources can be allocated for renewable energy along with technology and capital, which in turn affect economic growth positively. Hence, this paper supports the substitution of fossil energy with renewable energy and asserts that renewable energy can meet the expectations above if the Turkish government provides more incentives and becomes more active for renewable energy.

There are a number of studies in the literature that emphasize the role of the government in Turkey in the production and consumption of renewable energy. Some of these studies are Simsek and Simsek (2013), Kaygusuz (2002), Kaygusuz and Sari (2003), Baris and Kucukali (2012), Toklu (2013), and Ozcan (2018). It is widely agreed that government needs to form a more comprehensive and efficient energy policy along with an uncompromising implementation of it. Within this framework, some policy recommendations can be suggested as follows:
It is indeed very important for the government to design upgraded energy policies with a special focus on production and the widespread use of renewable energy sources in Turkey.
To this end, energy policies should aim to attract both the private sector and foreign investors. In this way, funds for investments in this sector would be mobilized by domestic and foreign private firms.
Government funds should be directed to speed infrastructure investments up since a well-established and strong infrastructure would reduce production costs, make production available, and therefore attract more private firms to renewable energy sector.
Renewable energy production is a relatively new area. Obtaining the most efficient and cost-friendly production technologies of renewables are of crucial importance. For this reason, Turkish government should prioritize to invest in developing brand new renewable energy production technologies. This means increasing research and development expenditures and all sorts of scientific activities funded by government agencies.
Upgraded and updated subsidies need to be transferred to the renewable energy sector for further and enhanced development. Current subsidies on fossil fuels should gradually be transferred to renewable energy sources. Besides, other incentive mechanisms need to be accompanied by regulatory policies to promote production and the widespread use of renewables.
Negative effects of renewables on the environment are much fewer than those of fossil fuels and renewable energy is supposed to be green and clean. However, both production and utilization of renewables may also have some negative environmental effects although they are small. It is important to eliminate or minimize these potential negative effects of renewable energy sources by proper calibration of production technologies and meticulous planning of the government.
Extensive afforestation programs must be executed in Turkey. In addition to this, exploitation of the forests need to be controlled more efficiently.
Evaluation of economic analysis criteria of hydroelectric power plants need to be carried out according to current conditions.
It has been mentioned that hydropower is the major renewable energy source in Turkey. Government should not solely depend on this type of electricity generation among all renewable energy sources. Other renewable energy sources in Turkey need to be utilized to the fullest extent.
The work required to strengthen the electricity transmission systems to allow for the interconnection of plants with intermittent production, such as more wind and solar energy power plants, should be accelerated.
Continuation of regeneration of geothermal resources in accordance with conservation principles should be carried out.
It is not enough for governments to support the development of renewable energy technologies. They must also support their commercial application all over the country.
More comprehensive and continuously updated measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are needed.
Imposing carbon taxes on fossil fuels to create a fund which can be used to incentivize and increase the deployment of renewables in Turkey should be considered. This would also allow renewable energy sources to compete with fossil fuels under more fair circumstances (Ozcan, 2018).
Informing the public and organizing training campaigns on the utilization of renewable energy would contribute to the efficient and widespread use of renewables. Organization of these activities and events need to be prioritized in the agenda of related government agencies.",Energy Policy,,
Renewable energy partnerships in development cooperation: Towards a relational understanding of technical assistance,"Highlights
Study of renewable energy partnerships in development cooperation.
Relational framework for analysis of inter-organisational technology diffusion.
Empirical cases of renewable energy partnerships in Central America.
Different types of network relationships enable/inhibit sustainable adoption.
Three policy recommendations for programme development.
Abstract
Recent decades have witnessed a surge in international programmes established to assist the adoption of renewable energy technologies (RETs) in low and lower-middle income countries. So far, such programmes have yielded mixed success. While partnerships between international, national and local organisations have become the pre-eminent model for RET programmes, we know relatively little about their contribution. This article traces the role of renewable energy partnerships in development cooperation, shifting the analytical emphasis from barriers and drivers to key actors and their relationships. It presents a relational approach for the analysis of development assistance for renewable energy, drawing on theories concerning the role of strong and weak ties in inter-organisational networks. Through an analysis of seven empirical cases from Central America, the article provides insights into how different forms of inter-organisational relationships can facilitate implementation of RET programmes but do not necessarily enhance the capacities of local organisations in a way to support a more sustainable adoption of RETs. On the basis of this analysis, theoretical and policy implications are given concerning the potential of relational approaches for researching technology diffusion processes, and the role of strong and weak ties for the success – or failure – of renewable energy partnerships. 5. Conclusions and policy implications
Based on a review of the literature on RET programmes in development cooperation, this article provided an overview of critical gaps inhibiting the success of international technical assistance in this field. Tracing the incremental development of RET programme designs, it was shown how multi-actor partnerships came to be seen as a means for improving the sustainability of development assistance for renewable energy. It was argued that the dominant analytical focus on success factors rather than partnership relations made it difficult to appreciate how renewable energy partnerships could deliver on such expectations. Drawing on theories concerning the role of strong and weak ties in inter-organisational networks, a relational framework for the analysis of RET partnerships was proposed. This framework then guided the analysis of seven empirical cases, showing how different configurations of strong and weak relationships can facilitate but also inhibit a more sustainable uptake of renewable energy technologies.

5.1. Theoretical implications: From ‘lessons learnt’ to theory
While these insights can be seen as contributions in their own right, the main thrust of this article is exploratory and programmatic as it shows how our understanding of renewable energy partnerships could be enhanced through an analytic approach focusing on actors and their relationships rather than success factors. The theoretical signposts above give an indication of the potential of such approach. However, it is important to recognise that ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ ties are analytical constructs that provide for parsimony in theory but represent just one (and perhaps a rather simplistic) framework for assessing the relationships between organisations (Cropper et al., 2010, Gulati et al., 2002). In addition, the short cases presented in this article cover only a few individual instances of one type of renewable energy partnerships. Case studies of this kind raise important questions about their generalizability. While the more detailed implications of each of the seven cases are likely to be case-specific, the study also confirmed and expanded upon several findings from other studies suggesting that some of the mechanisms identified in this article may apply to a wider range of renewable energy partnerships.

Overall, the article demonstrates the considerable contribution that relational theories could make to this field, as it brought into view micro-processes of inter-organisational learning and collaboration that have so far been hidden in the ‘black box’ of renewable energy partnerships. Further research is needed in order to better understand how different types of partnerships address resource, learning, implementation and regulatory gaps at the local, national and global level. Until now, researchers have not taken full advantage of the vast amount of literature in organisation studies to unravel the complexity of technical assistance for low-carbon development. Future research on renewable energy partnerships could draw on theories from economic sociology, organisation theory and social network analysis that seek to explain how distinct constellations of actors, relationships and modes of governance shape organisational behaviour and decision making (Cropper et al., 2010, Crossley, 2011, Ellersiek, 2011, Oerlemans et al., 2007). Such ‘knowledge growth by extension’ may turn out to be a fruitful strategy for all disciplines involved, given that research into learning processes in cross-sector and transnational settings is still in its infancy (Brinkerhoff and Morgan, 2010, Knight, 2002, Stagl, 2007).

After having discussed the considerable promise of relational research on renewable energy partnerships, it is important to note a number of challenges that come with a relational approach. In-depth micro-studies of renewable energy partnerships are time-consuming and prone to issues around access, sampling and generalizability. Furthermore, the multiplex and dynamic nature of inter-organisational relationships can make it difficult to differentiate effects (Brass et al., 2004). For example, learning may take place between individuals, between organisations, at the partnership and at the sector level—and many learning effects can be assumed to be interdependent. While relational studies have the potential for bridging the micro-macro divide and enhancing our understanding of multi-level phenomena (Crossley, 2011), they also risk falling between the cracks created by macro-oriented policy discourses focusing on factors rather than relationships.

"Renewable energy policy and landscape management in Andalusia, Spain: The facts","Renewable energy has developed spectacularly in Spain since the European Union started a process of energy policy reform. A review of Spanish State legislation on renewable energies confirms that the success in installing renewable energy is attributable to public aid. Andalusia is one of the autonomous communities, which has simultaneously developed the legal framework and very successfully implemented the introduction of renewable power. When implementing the central government’s policy, the Andalusian regional government prioritised increases in both surface cover by wind and solar plants (thermal and photovoltaic energy) and in the number of companies involved. However, this development of renewable energies took place without any proper integration into regional spatial and landscape planning. This paper explores renewable power implementation in Andalusia through regulatory measures put in place over the last decade to develop renewable energy systems and the way they can be managed alongside planning issues. The location of large-scale renewable plants has had consequences for territory in the socio-political context of renewable energy promotion. The main findings focus on renewable energy plant sprawl throughout rural areas in Andalusia with no clear effect on landscape management and no firm backing from the local population. Renewable energies are at the core of proposals included in international commitments to a reduction in emissions and the greater sustainability of energy consumption, which augurs well for further installations. This paper analyses the renewable energy implementation process in Spain and in Andalusia. The legislative measures driven by the central government and the Andalusian autonomous government’s energy plans together explain the success of renewable energy installation. The article details the results regarding technology implementation for sun-based energy generation. Very broad progress has been made at a great rate in the case of photovoltaic technology: to 2010, 672.47 MW had been connected to the grid out of the 823.80 MW total authorised in 2008.

The renewable energy boom should also be assessed with respect to the surface area occupied by the new installations in general, and their spread over agricultural land in particular. Progress in the numbers and power of installations has been driven by hefty incentives from public subsidies in the energy field. However, energy planning and the on-the-ground planning of renewable energy plants are clearly out-of-step. Measures aimed at subsidising the rapid growth of energy generated by renewable energy technologies have not been accompanied by any planning of the installations in the territory. This would seem to undervalue the implications of the process for the territory and the landscape, although it has been clearly demonstrated that neither should be regarded in this way. This article has exposed a number of shortcomings that question the safe and beneficial image that solar energy has in particular. The technology that produces energy from the sun uses a renewable resource, but that does not mean that the installations are harmless for the environment. The article also analyses the environmental and territorial implications that renewable energy plants have, especially photovoltaic plants sited on agricultural land. Meeting sustainable energy targets through the use of renewable energy technologies will have other collateral effects that are difficult to forecast. Some of these side-effects have been revealed in this article, including changes in land cover and use, the disappearance of crops, the need for water to keep solar thermal technology plants up and running, and the expansion of photovoltaic plants on agricultural land in a greater number of municipalities.

It is evident that a balanced appraisal of the environmental effects of solar energy plants should include all the aspects relating to the installation of plants for energy production. Renewable energies cannot be regarded exclusively as a much sought-after panacea for energy challenges. The complexity of the interrelations associated with these new energies has to be brought to the table and scientific arguments used in the debate on the harmless and beneficial image that they have for the global environment. Renewable energies cannot be proclaimed as torchbearers of sustainability if they jeopardise the future of the territory and the landscape. Changes in land use contribute to the transformation of cultural landscapes as a focal part of heritage. And they lead to the creation of new landscape structures, which must be modelled to minimise the impact of renewable power plants. Landscape change is at the nub of the spread of renewable energy production and as such should be considered as part of spatial and energy planning. The credibility of landscape protection policies and the sustainability of renewable energies itself is rooted in this.",Energy Policy,,
Renewable energy policy in Germany and Malaysia: Success factors,"Energy-sectors in both developed and developing countries face three major challenges namely emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), depletion of fossil fuel reserves, and increasing demands. Despite renewable energy retains many advantages over fossil-based energy, its wider dissemination is still restricted in many countries owing to techno-economic, societal and policy barriers. Renewable energy policy is meant to promote renewable energy by overcoming these barriers. Globally more than 140 countries had laid policy measures to promote the development of renewable energy, however, very few countries are successful. Germany is one of the successful countries in the world in developing renewable energy in terms of per capita installation and cumulative capacity expansion. Malaysia, on the other hand, undertook several initiatives in order to increase renewable energy uses to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and to contribute global effort to minimize GHG emissions but is not yet as successful as it desires. This paper examines renewable energy policy of both these countries, and identifies the key success factors in German case. We found that the main success factors of Germany were appropriate and dynamic FiT (Feed-in Tariff) mechanism. German Feed-in Tariff mechanism ensures marginal profits with the negotiated Feed-in Tariff rates. Energy policy is meant to address issues of energy developments including energy production, transformation,
exploration, distribution and consumption. Renewable energy policy facilities to adopt Renewable Energy by dealing various barriers and
challenging issues such as technological barriers, market failures, societal challenges, negative perception, higher transaction
costs, competitors etc.
 Germany is a very successful country for using renewable energy sources in terms of cumulative generation, per capital
installed capacity, and current dissemination rates. The effective energy policy was the main driver for these achievements in
Germany because 88% of renewable energy investment in power generation installation in 2011 was channelled through
Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG).
 Malaysia also has initiated several policies and programs to promote renewable energy applications. The main goals of
Malaysia Renewable Energy policies were to encourage communities and individuals to adopt Renewable energy as alternative sources of energy. Despite
several policy efforts, Malaysia renewable energy is not as successful as it desires. In this context, this article examines the
renewable policy of Germany and Malaysia to figure out the main factors in Renewable energy policy of Germany that are
missing in case of Malaysia. The authors found that the main success factors of Germany are appropriate Feed-in Tariff mechanism and
supportive environment. German Feed-in Tariff mechanism gives that the Feed-in Tariff rates are negotiated to be such that at current investment
prices, marginal profits are maintained. German RE policy ensures minimizing transaction costs by simplifying and
transparent process. Germany also made obligation for renewable energy applications for transportation and heating sectors,
which also made a great push towards wider Renewable Energy deployment. Germany also ensures improvement of transmission and
distribution system to adopt power from renewable energy sources. Germany also provides long term perspective for big
investment and capacity expansion. Despite Malaysia Renewable energy policy deploy many good features for expediting renewable energy
penetration, it clearly lack some of the features that German’s Renewable Energy policy has. Countries which are not successful yet in renewable energy programme can upgrade Renewable Energy policy based on German experience to facilitate further pace for renewables
dissemination in their energy mix. ",International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,,
Renewable energy policy scenarios as implementation moderation of fuel subsidy policy in Indonesia,"This paper aims to examine the effect of communication, resources, disposition and bureaucratic structure to the success of energy subsidy policy, to examine the effect of moderation of variable scenario of renewable energy policy on the influence of communication, resources, disposition and bureaucracy structure on the success of energy subsidy policy. This paper exhibited that all relationships between variables have a p-value of 0.05 except the third moderation and fourth moderation relationship. So it can be said that all relationships between variables are significant except the relationship between the variables of moderation to the relationship between the disposition variable (X3) on the successful implementation of subsidy policy (Y) and the relationship between the moderation variable to the relationship between bureaucracy structure variable (X4) to the successful implementation of subsidy policy. The results of this study and the findings produced have not been able to provide a holistic explanation of the issues concerning renewable energy policy as the implementation of fuel subsidy policy. This is due to the inherent limitations of the researchers themselves and the obstacles that exist in the implementation of research, including the following:

Primary data of this study obtained through questionnaires, the choice of answers based on the perceptions of some members of the Community Care and Environmental Concern (MPEL) and Indonesian Renewable Energy Society (METI) sampled. Assessment based on this perception can experience social desirability bias, which is the bias that arises because the respondent gives an answer that he or she considers appropriate or good according to his own personal size, but does not necessarily reflect the variables studied (Arnold and Feldman, 1982). This makes it difficult for researchers to oversee the truth and honesty of members of the Concerned Environmental and Energy Community (MPEL) Community and the Indonesian Renewable Energy Society (METI) in their choice of answers in accordance with actual circumstances and reality, although the letter of introduction to the questionnaire has been submitted that the honesty of completing this questionnaire will not reveal the general identity of the customer.
Although the number of samples in this study meets SEM assumptions, the number of samples still needs to be enlarged so that the results can be used to generalize the renewable energy policy moderation model in its implementation on the fuel subsidy policy.",FORESIGHT,,
Renewable energy technology acceptance in Peninsular Malaysia,"Despite various policies, renewable energy resources have not been developed in Malaysia. This study investigates the factors that influence renewable energy technology acceptance in Peninsular Malaysia and attempts to show the impact of cost and knowledge on the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of renewable energy technology. The results show that cost of renewable energy has an indirect effect on attitudes towards using renewable energy through the associated impact on the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The results also indicate that public knowledge in Peninsular Malaysia does not affect perceived ease of use, although the positive impact of knowledge on perceived usefulness is supported. Furthermore, our results show that the current business environment in Peninsular Malaysia does not support the adoption of renewable energy technology, and thus, renewable energy technology is not commercially viable in Peninsular Malaysia. Additionally, the population of Peninsular Malaysia associates the use of renewable energy with a high level of effort and therefore has a negative attitude towards the use of renewable energy technology. There is, therefore, a definite need to pay more attention to the role of public perception and awareness in the successes and failures of renewable energy policy. The Malaysian government has begun to focus on renewable energy to address the climate change challenge and meet energy needs in a sustainable way. Renewable energy was first announced in the country's energy mix through the Fifth Fuel Policy under the 8th Malaysian Plan. Over the past 14 years, the government of Malaysia has applied many different policies to promote the implementation of renewable energy as an alternative energy. Despite the continuous efforts to develop renewable energy, renewable energy is not yet utilized to its maximum potential in Malaysia, and the implementation of renewable energy policy has a received a sluggish response.

By proposing a technology acceptance framework, this study set out to understand the public's acceptance of renewable energy technologies in Peninsular Malaysia, as public acceptance of renewable energy technology is an essential element for diffusion and development of renewable energy. To this end, a structure equation model was employed to analyze data collected by surveying residents’ intentions to use renewable energy in four regions of Peninsular Malaysia. This represents the first study reporting the applicability of technology acceptance models in Malaysia, as most previously published studies have focused on data from western countries (e.g., Sweden, the UK).

This study has shown that PU is an important factor in influencing the intention to use renewable energy. The second major finding was that PEOU is also an important factor affecting the intention to use renewable energy. These findings enhance our understanding of the barriers to developing renewable energy in Malaysia.

The results of this survey may motivate policy makers to pay more attention to the role of public perception and awareness in the successes and failures of renewable energy policy. This study has raised our understanding about important role of public knowledge in renewable energy acceptance in Peninsular Malaysia.

There is, therefore, a definite need for increasing the awareness of the public about the costs and benefits of renewable/sustainable energy technologies through suitable programs and campaigns. Another important practical implication is that education and material dissemination related to renewable energy should be introduced at all school levels and information from resource studies about various renewable technologies should be made available through government programs and initiatives. Considering the fact that in the energy sector, government R&D programs play a vital role in the development of renewable energy technology (Jacobsson and Johnson, 2000), a key government priority should be to increase budget appropriations for environmental R&D. Moreover, efforts are needed to contribute to local knowledge, which is knowledge that is “practical, collective and strongly rooted in a particular place” (Geertz, 2000), and to stimulate the policymaking process from problem definition and policy formulation to policy implementation and policy evaluation.

The results of the SEM analysis confirm the expectancy that the intention to use renewable energy is influenced by the cost of renewable energy technology. Cost affects users’ motivation for using renewable energy by its indirect impact on PU and PEOU. It is therefore important that the cost of renewable energy products be reduced, especially for end users. These findings suggest several courses of action for controlling market risk and reducing the cost of renewable energy technology, which should be done by the government. Management to remove distortionary subsidies for fossil fuel consumption and production should be a key focus of governmental energy policy. As fundamental fiscal policy, a green tax should be implemented that levies taxes on activities and products that have a negative impact on the environment and curtails subsidies that favor unsustainable development. As the result of this study shows that knowledge only affects PU, further studies are needed to validate the impact of knowledge on PU and PEOU. This study finds that the majority of Malaysians are concerned about climate change. Similarly, Corner et al. (2011) reported that 71% of the UK population were either fairly or very concerned about climate change. It seems that the level of concern regarding global warming in Peninsular Malaysia is approximately equal to that in the population of the UK. The results of this study showed that the term “climate change” evoked different free associations among the Malaysian public. Following this strategy, respondents in this study were asked their opinion regarding climate change associations and, as shown in Fig. 5, results showed that the term climate change elicits significantly more associations with weather than with GHGs. Interestingly, Leiserowitz et al. (2014) also reported that, for the American public, climate change also evokes significantly more associations with weather.

This is the first study to investigate the effects of PU and PEOU on attitudes toward using renewable energy technology in the Malaysian context. The results of this study indicate that both these factors are important in determining the acceptance and use of renewable energy in Malaysia. This finding is supported by Liang and Yi-Hsuan (2009), who claimed that PU has been proven to be the most significant element in explaining why people adopt a technology and because of that, this concept “has remained relatively unchanged since the inception of the research stream.” Venkatesh et al. (2003) also mentioned that PU is a powerful element for “intention to use” in technology adoption. Similarly, Han (2003) pointed out that in determining usage behavior, the importance of PU should be stressed. The PU has been consistently shown to be a powerful predictor for “intention to use” in technology adoptions and related literature (Venkatesh et al., 2003).

Modeling results suggest that the cost of renewable energy has an indirect effect on attitudes towards using renewable energy through associated impacts on PU and PEOU. A possible explanation for this might be that Malaysia is among the nations with the highest fossil fuels subsidies. Subsidies for fossil fuels have resulted in market failure and made it difficult for renewable energy technologies to compete economically. The cost of producing and using renewable energy is therefore relatively expensive. Fig. 7 provides more details concerning fuel subsidies in Malaysia between 1990 and 2010. Note that in 2007, energy subsidies in Malaysia were the second largest in the ASEAN region (after Indonesia) and exceeded 8 billion USD. Another possible explanation is that in Malaysia the electricity price was low and did not account for the external costs. Because of inadequate tariffs, renewable energy producers could not sell their power to the market at a profitable price. Fig. 8 shows the electricity prices for selected countries.",Energy Policy,,
Renewable Energy Technology and Path Creation: A Multi-scalar Approach to Energy Transition in the UK.,"This paper examines the potential contribution of UK regions for developing and deploying renewable energy technologies to achieve the government target of obtaining 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. The paper argues for a multi-scalar approach to energy transition theory and policy. National-scale processes and policies need to be complemented by regional and local policies in order to discover and incorporate meso-level sources of renewable energy, recognize that niche or path creation is a geographically localized process and mobilize heterogeneous, local actors around common “regional energy visions” to improve implementation of renewable energy projects. After critically reviewing the main theoretical approach to energy transitions, the multi-level perspective, the paper employs patent data to describe the comparative position of UK regions in the renewable energy sector and examines the success of Danish, German and Spanish regions resulting from strong government intervention at the national level supplemented by region-specific strategies. A number of policy strengths and shortcomings are identified in the evolutionary trajectory of the UK energy system including weak technology push and policy pull factors. Finally, the paper reviews existing regional renewable energy policy and speculates on the potential impact of recent changes in spatial and energy policies on the ability to deploy and develop renewable energy sources in the UK. Climate change and energy security are the main drivers of the transition process towards a low-carbon socio-technical energy regime. There are a number of possible ways to achieve this transition but in the long run, renewable energy generation is imperative. The UK is characterized by a highly centralized system where efficiency gains (low-cost energy) were the main goal for private producers, grid operators and suppliers. In order to unlock the existing energy system, a number of changes must occur simultaneously. First, the comparative analysis at the national scale together with results from econometric analysis (Johnstone et al., [47]) demonstrate that strong government incentives for demand creation (such as FITs) and technology push (public R&D investment) are necessary to speed up deployment and development of Renewable Energy Technology. Manipulation of landscapes in which energy regimes are embedded is essential. Second, the UK has an R&D, innovation and skills gap in most renewable technology areas that needs to be closed rapidly to take advantage of the ""green revolution"" and thus support niche development. The recent increase in R&D budgets and patenting activity supplemented by support or Renewable Energy Technologies by DECC, BIS and NPS for Energy indicate steps in the right directions but may be funded insufficiently for the energy sector to meet its targets (it is estimated that £100 billion need to be invested between now and 2020 to meet the targets set out in the roadmap). Third, in order to speed up niche innovations, a multi-scalar approach to energy transitions should be applied with sub-national policies complementing national policies. Regional and local policies can take advantage of locally specific regime configurations, benefit from localized spillovers, help maintain technological diversity and are more likely to enrol a large number of actors in the transition project, triggering the development of common regional visions that will be easier to implement than ""distant"" national guidelines. The recent change in legislation to allow local authorities to own and benefit economically from renewable energy projects and regional capacity studies for local authorities to identify locally specific renewable energy policies are potentially important steps in that direction. However, radical changes to planning and energy policies could generate uncertainty and further delay the development and deployment of renewable energy. It needs to be seen whether LEPs will be able to work with local authorities on developing sustainable, local growth strategies built on the creation and deployment of renewable energy sources. As the case of Navarra demonstrated, strong regional support for the deployment of RETs can then result in cluster formation that can improve national comparative advantages in the sector. While the sub-national scale is important to speed up RET deployment and niche development and garner local support for RETs, they cannot function independently from strong incentive policies at the national scale. While it is important to consider the sub-national scale in transition research and policy, an exclusive focus on the sub-national scale and neglect of national and supra-scale processes will result in an incomplete understanding of those processes.",European Planning Studies,,
"Renewable energy, trade performance and the conditional role of !nance and institutional capacity in sub-Sahara African countries","Renewable energy usage adversely affects total trade and manufacturing export in SSA.

Finance and regulation improves renewable energy and total trade nexus.
Corruption control matters for manufacturing export nexus, but not total trade.


Abstract
The paper investigates the dynamic relationship between renewable energy usage and trade performance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), while considering the conditioning role of corruption control, regulatory quality, and the private sector access to finance. Focusing on 42 SSA countries for the period 2004–2016, and engaging the System generalized method of moments (GMM) technique for its estimation, this study found a negative relationship between renewable energy usage and the indicators of trade performance. However, with corruption control, improved regulatory framework, and better finance for the private sector, there are potentials for a positive net impact of renewable energy usage on manufacturing export. For renewable energy and total trade nexus, we find that improved regulatory framework, and better finance for the private sector are important conditioning structures. These findings are significant because they highlight the different important structures of SSA countries that improves the effect of renewable energy use on trade outcomes. For instance, the consideration of the financial, institutional and regulatory frameworks in SSA countries in conditioning the renewable energy-trade nexus stipulates a clear policy pathway for countries in this region as the debate for transition to the use of renewable energy progresses. This paper assessed the relationship between renewable energy usage and trade performance for countries in sub-Sahara Africa. It examined how three conditioning variables (indicators of institutional structure, regulatory framework and finance) can mitigate the hypothetical cost of renewable energy on trade performance in SSA countries. Despite the ‘cost’ of renewable energy, this study highlights its potential economic, social and environmental benefits such as enhancement of the productive capacity of economic agents in the region for trade outcomes. Overall, the results suggest that there are potentials for a positive net impact on manufacturing export with the usage of renewable energy and the improvements in the institutional structure (i.e. strengthening corruption control), regulatory framework, and finance for the private sector. In contrast, the net impact on total trade as a second measure of trade performance is only positive for regulatory framework and finance for private sector. These results are consistent with some other empirical studies like Boluk (2013) and Raza et al. (2015).

A number of reasons are given to explain these results. First, the cost of doing business increases from informal payments and other unlawful fiscal payments to import, register, and approve technologies in countries where there is poor control of corruption. Such cost declines the productivity and competitiveness of firms with the adoption of renewable energy. Further, other public-private initiatives and funding to help the private sector ameliorate the huge financial burden in adopting renewable technology will be inefficiently directed and utilized in countries with poor corruption-control. More so, it is a notable experience that some initiatives to boost technology growth in African countries are met with public administration bottlenecks, which are most times tied to corrupt public officers seeking for private benefit from such initiatives. The underlining fact is that with corruption-control, the cost of adopting renewable energy will be reduced, and firm accessibility to government programmes and other efforts to boost energy usage can be more efficient for better productivity and competitiveness in this region, which will have a positive impact on trade outcomes.

Secondly, when government policies and regulations are in favor of firms adopting renewable energy, this can reverse the negative relationship earlier observed between renewable energy usage and trade outcomes. This could be in terms of availability of subsidies and research and development support, thus enhancing the overall productivity of firms that participate in the export market. More so, regulatory quality can also affect the prices of renewable energy, by allowing for a freer renewable energy market for consumers, and other fiscal and pricing incentives to encourage renewable energy usage (Obeng-Darko, 2019). These efforts will enhance the productivity of firms and their export competitiveness.

Finally, in terms of access to credit, firms’ performance will improve with the usage of renewable energy when they have sufficient financial support to adopt such technology. Even though the availability of cost effective and potentially efficient renewable energy technologies is a necessary condition for growth (Kalirajan and Lin, 2016), these technologies are still relatively expensive for many small and medium scale enterprises in this region (Efobi et al., 2019). Implying that in cases where there are better access to finance for the private sector, the potential for a positive outcome from the adoption of renewable energy is higher, which fits the result seen from the earlier estimations.

The main policy implication of the results from this paper is that renewable energy usage is expensive on trade – including manufacturing export, in the SSA region. However, with the improvement of vital structural factors such as enhanced access to finance, regulatory quality, corruption-control, the costs associated with the negative impact can be minimized and even eradicated in the long term.",Energy Policy,,
Solar Community Organizations and active peer effects in the adoption of residential PV ,"Solar Community Organizations (SCOs) are formal or informal organizations and citizen groups that help to reduce the barriers to the adoption of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) by (1) providing access to credible and transparent information about the localized benefits of residential PV and (2) actively campaigning to encourage adoption within their operational boundaries. We study the peer effect, or social interaction, process catalyzed by SCOs to understand the impact of these organizations on the residential PV market. Using a standardized search methodology across spatial scales (state; city; neighborhoods), we identify and characterize the operations of 228 SCOs formed in the U.S. between 1970 and 2012. We also present case studies of four successful SCOs and find that a common thread of why these SCOs are successful involves effectively leveraging trusted community networks combined with putting together a complete information and financial-tools package for use by interested communities. Finally, our findings suggest that empirical studies that attempt statistical identification and estimation of peer effects should pay close attention to the role of SCOs, as the social interactions engendered by SCOs may be correlated both with the level of social learning and the socio-demographic characteristics of the communities of interest.
Moreover, based on the case studies, three elements are critical to the success of any solar campaign. First, a campaign should involve a local champion(s)—a person(s) who is well connected, active and well known in the community—who is motivated to have his or her community go solar. Second, the community must have existing networks. A well-connected community is more likely to succeed than a relatively disconnected or inactive community. Peer effects play a large role in the success of a Solarize program because neighbors communicated with and motivate neighbors in the complex process. Lastly, there needs to be a financial piece. More consumers have been influenced to adopt solar when a local financial institution provides low (or no) interest loans for their solar system. Financing options that are attractive and nearby in the community are preferred because they are the more accessible and trustworthy options. These three measures, when combined, are likely to lead to a successful PV adoption program run by a SCO. Our analysis identified a number of characteristics that lead to the operational success of SCOs. These organizations are unique in their ability to inform and influence consumer decision-making because of the trust networks they hold through longstanding linkages with key individuals in local communities. Working in partnership with governments, private entities, and other non-profits, they support a variety of programs that actively seek to engage consumers to consider installing solar PV. This process of active engagement is described in the peer effects framework in Fig. 8. Governments provide support in the form of rebate programs, solar-friendly building regulations, and workshops. Similarly, other non-profit organizations (including universities) provide technical assistance, research, facilities, and informational resources, while solar companies may contribute by providing discount pricing for PV systems. SCOs, however, are often the key organizational linkage that brings these resources together, communicates their availability and value to citizens, and pioneers coordinated programs to encourage adoption of PV. The success of these programs relies heavily on the status of SCO members as trusted opinion leaders with a history of commitment to the local community. Without this trust relationship, other programs are unlikely to achieve high penetration or success. Understanding the characteristics of SCOs provides useful insights about the distribution of support for solar energy and the activities of organizations that have been successful in encouraging solar adoption, especially via catalyzing positive peer effects. These organizations are an important part of the support infrastructure seeking to harness grassroots support for solar energy and catalyze the adoption of residential rooftop PV.

5.1. ""Shock"" Events catalyze grassroots environmental action
Our analysis suggests that periods of heightened scrutiny and public concern about the sources and environmental consequences of energy production translate into grassroots activity and mobilization to encourage the adoption of renewable energy. As expected, the majority of SCO clusters are located in high population states, especially those with high electricity rates and favorable solar policies (for example, California and Massachusetts). Moreover, some outliers such as Washington, DC can be explained by the number of organizations with headquarter addresses in the city for the purpose of pursuing an advocacy or policy agenda. Concern for the environment is among the top reasons cited in SCO mission statements as a rationale for founding the organizations and promoting renewable energy. For example, many organizations founded in the 1970s specifically reference the oil crisis and its economic consequences as a motivating factor and a reason for promoting non-fossil domestic energy production. Similarly, many SCOs formed from 2001 to present cite global warming as a primary rationale.

5.2. Trust networks are the focal point in the success of SCOs
Our analysis identified a number of characteristics that lead to the operational success of SCOs. These organizations are unique in their ability to inform and influence consumer decision-making because of the trust networks they hold through longstanding linkages with key individuals in local communities. Working in partnership with governments, private entities, and other non-profits, they support a variety of programs that actively seek to engage consumers to consider installing solar PV. This process of active engagement is described in the peer effects framework in Fig. 8. Governments provide support in the form of rebate programs, solar-friendly building regulations, and workshops. Similarly, other non-profit organizations (including universities) provide technical assistance, research, facilities, and informational resources, while solar companies may contribute by providing discount pricing for PV systems. SCOs, however, are often the key organizational linkage that brings these resources together, communicates their availability and value to citizens, and pioneers coordinated programs to encourage adoption of PV. The success of these programs relies heavily on the status of SCO members as trusted opinion leaders with a history of commitment to the local community. Without this trust relationship, other programs are unlikely to achieve high penetration or success.",Energy Policy,,
South Africa's Renewable Energy IPP Procurement Program : Success Factors and Lessons,"South Africa occupies a central position in the global debate regarding the most effective policy instruments to accelerate and sustain private investment in renewable energy. In 2009, the government began exploring feed-in tariffs (FITs) for renewable energy, but these were later rejected in favor of competitive tenders. The resulting program, now known as the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program ), has successfully channeled substantial private sector expertise and investment into grid-connected renewable energy in South Africa at competitive prices. To date, a total of 64 projects have been awarded to the private sector, and the first projects are already on line. Private sector investment totaling US$14 billion has been committed, and these projects will generate 3922 megawatt (MW) of renewable power. Prices have dropped over the three bidding phases with average solar photovoltaic (PV) tariffs decreasing by 68 percent and wind dropping by 42 percent, in nominal terms. Most impressively, these achievements all occurred over a two-and-a-half year period. Finally, there have been notable improvements in the economic development commitments, primarily benefiting rural communities. One investor characterized Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  as 'the most successful public-private partnership in Africa in the last 20 years.' Important lessons can be learned for both South Africa and other emerging markets contemplating investments in renewables and other critical infrastructure investments. The next section attempts to identify factors that account for the success of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program . In addition, the section looks at program
shortcomings, as well as some of the risks going forward. These factors are organized under three general headings: 1) program
management, which primarily covers the government’s administration of the program, how it was done, who did it, etc.; 2) program design,
which includes the size and structure of the program; and 3) market factors, which include characteristics of the marketplace environment in
which the bidding took place, including the bidders, private financiers, advisors, as well as donors and multilateral development banks. Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  benefited tremendously from high-level political support, in the form of a relatively long history of policy statements on renewable
energy, but more importantly, President Zuma’s commitment to green energy during the COP15 meeting in Copenhagen and South Africa’s
subsequent hosting of COP17 in Durban, where the government’s Green Accord with business and other stakeholders was signed.
A deeper analysis of the political economy of these commitments is required but is beyond the scope of this paper. Why did South Africa
voluntarily commit to reducing carbon emissions when it faced no binding obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change or the Kyoto protocol? And why did South Africa proceed even though its Copenhagen offer was subject to financial
assistance that has not materialized? Post Copenhagen, South Africa transformed its electricity planning. It incorporated a carbon emissions
cap in its Integrated Resource Plan and for the first time renewable energy options featured even though the overall cost of the electricity
plan increased. For a country as dependent on coal for its energy, and facing extraordinary poverty and development challenges, this was
a striking break from the past. The effectiveness of the Department of Environmental Affairs in building coalitions and influencing the
Department of Energy, Eskom and industry stakeholders to accept a new electricity-planning paradigm deserves more in-depth study.
6.1.2 Institutional setting
The largely ad hoc institutional status of the DOE IPP unit, acting at arm’s length from DOE as a kind of dedicated project office, allowed
and, to some extent, encouraged an operating approach that emphasized problem solving to make the program successful, rather than
automatically following government operational policies and procedures that emphasized enforcement of rules.
6.1.3 The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  management team
The team and the team leader had extensive experience working with the private sector. They had an excellent working knowledge of PPP
contracts; experience managing consultants, and credibility with both public and private sector stakeholders. 6.1.4 Management style
Because of its background and skills, the DOE IPP unit exhibited none of the kind of mistrust of private business that sometimes
characterizes other government agencies in South Africa. Dialogue with private sector counterparts on key Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  issues began almost
immediately as did the use of external, private sector expert advisors.
6.1.5 Program resources
By successfully accessing funding from sources like the DBSA, donors, and a National Treasury jobs fund, then establishing a mechanism to
capture fees from closed projects, the program was able to remain largely off the formal government budget through the first three bidding
rounds.
6.1.6 Quality of transaction advice
The DOE IPP unit made sure that they selected experienced local and international transaction advisors who would be successfully able to
transfer international best practice in PPPs and renewable energy procurement into the South Africa context. Teams of professionals from
different legal and financial firms were required to sit together to draft procurement documentation and contracts. There was excellent
cooperation between these firms and the end result was a quality procurement process.
6.1.7 Program management shortcomings
The transaction costs for the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  program were generally high for both the government and the bidders and certainly higher than for a
REFIT program. The government has had to rely on external transaction advisers. There is potential for the transfer of skills and experience in
future procurement rounds and to build capacity in the proposed independent system and market operator. But it is unclear how quickly such
capacity can be built to levels where substantial external advice will not be needed. Unless handled carefully, the early departure of external
advisors could be viewed as a signal of program decline.
6.1.8 Program management risks going fo rward
One of the most significant risks to the sustainable success of Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  relates to one of the program’s key success factors – its ad hoc
character. The non-departmental institutional setting, the off-budget funding, and the entrepreneurial attitude of the project have all helped
facilitate the programs successful performance and avoid the delays and indecision that in the past have crippled earlier attempts to develop
IPPs in the power sector. But this ad hoc character will inevitably give way to some kind of formalization, if only to guarantee a more secure
source of funding and sustainability for the program. The challenge will then be to proceed with institutionalization in a way that preserves as
many of the program management success factors as possible. If Eskom is unbundled in the future, then it will make sense to locate future
IPP procurements in the Independent System and Market Operator. 6.2.1 Accelerated roll-out of new generating capacity
Despite the higher initial cost of renewable energy, Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  offered South Africans something they thought they urgently needed in 2011,
a relatively fast way to roll out new power generating capacity. While it would take years for the large power projects planned by Eskom to
begin generating power, Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  was designed to roll out a significant amount of power in a very short time, using transparent procurement
and implementation processes. Stakeholders of all kinds, including critics of the initial higher cost of renewable energy, appear to have
adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program , giving it time to build momentum. As renewable energy costs fall, and South Africa faces
ongoing supply shortages, industry players are asking why the DOE is not contracting more renewable energy that is on offer.
6.2.2 Program size
6.2.3 Potential project profitability
Initially, Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  clearly represented opportunities for developers to make reasonable profits. When the Round 1 bid documents were
released in August 2011, developers saw what one called “REFIT-like” tariffs with caps set at or near REFIT levels, meaning that the projects
could potentially make equity returns close to 17 percent. The clear potential for profitable Round 1 projects helped initiate interest in the
program on the part of a wide range of bidders, which has carried over into subsequent bid rounds.
6.2.4 The shift from FITs to competitive tenders
The shift to competitive tendering seems to have helped tariffs come down sharply after Round 1, and this reduction was a major factor in
the government’s willingness to continue its support for Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  as a “successful” program. For many developing countries and emerging
markets, including South Africa, the argument for greater use of potentially more expensive renewable energy technologies resonates only
when efforts are made to clearly keep costs under control. Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  does not prove conclusively that competitive tendering is better able to
do that than FIT programs, but it does suggest that this might be the case and should be explored more vigorously even in contexts where
electricity markets are not as large.
6.2.5 Multiple bidding rounds
A key design alteration made before August 2011 was to change the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  from a once-off tender to a rolling series of bid rounds. The
multiple bid rounds have had a significant impact in terms of building confidence in the program among operators and investors and
generating increasing levels of competition as more and more of these players begin to participate in the tendering. Overall, the number of
bidders increased by 49 percent from the first to second rounds, and another 18 percent in the third round. 6.2.6 Exemption from PPP regulations
Exempting IPPs from national PPP regulations by defining the national government-owned power utility – in its role as the off-taker
and contractor – as something other than a government agency, employs a definitional distinction that would not always be possible in
other countries. But whatever the reasoning, subjecting these IPPs to South Africa’s complex and time-consuming PPP rules would have
dramatically slowed and, perhaps subverted, this successful program.
6.2.7 Non-negotiable program characteristics
In some ways, Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  was perceived to be “private sector–friendly,” but the team also had enough experience with private sector
investment deals to understand where and how to control bidder behavior and restrict opportunities for gamesmanship or time-consuming
negotiations. Chief among these efforts were the non-negotiable PPAs and IAs that were made available to bidders along with other tender
documents, the standardized set of financial data that bidders were required to provide for evaluation models, and the requirement that bids
be fully underwritten with debt as well as equity.19 This latter requirement effectively eliminated one of the main shortcomings of typical
tender processes – that they incentivize under-bidding (or “low-balling”) to win contracts, then renegotiation in the hopes of securing more
profitable deals.
6.2.8 Economic development requirements
Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program ’s economic development requirements have been controversial, often confusing, and expensive for bidders to respond to these
requirements. But in South Africa, as in other countries, these requirements have also helped to generate political support for these programs
from politicians, investors, as well as the general public. By increasing the role of these factors to 30 percent of bid value, the program helped
increase the visibility of economic development considerations and underscore their importance. The South African Parliament seems to
have concluded that the economic development dimension of the program has been successful, based on the commitments made during
the bid rounds.
6.2.9 Sovereign guarantee
The political will behind the program, mentioned above under management factors, was given practical shape in the form of sovereign
guarantees in the Implementation Agreements backing Eskom’s purchase of power from the renewable energy projects. The National
Treasury’s Fiscal Liability Committee that formally approved the issuing of the government guaranty scrutinized the transactions. (There is
no reserve fund or contingent liability fund set aside for each transaction). South Africa’s relatively strong international credit standing means
that banks and investors will accept sovereign country risk without requiring political risk insurance, as would be the case in virtually every
other African country. What is interesting is that these sovereign guarantees were required (or offered) despite Eskom’s investment grade
credit rating. Clearly, there are concerns around Eskom’s financial standing and perhaps the prospects of unbundling and electricity sector
reform. 6.2.10 Program design shortcomings
•	 Market readiness overestimated. The size and readiness of the local renewable energy market were initially overestimated, resulting in
limited competition in Round 1 and bid prices close to the price caps. It might have been more prudent to start smaller, then gradually
ramp up the program, with larger blocks of capacity being offered in subsequent rounds.
•	 Closed envelope bids versus dynamic reverse auctions. Use of the single-price offer (rather than a dynamic reverse auction as employed,
for example, in Brazil) also may have restricted competition.20
•	 High transaction costs. The transaction costs for the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  were higher for both the government and the bidders than they would
have been for a REFIT program, although these costs were ultimately small for investors compared to the overall project costs. Without
its early access to adequate financial resources and expertise, the DOE IPP unit would have struggled to achieve the quality levels that
contributed so much the continuing interest of private sector players in Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program .
•	 Bias against SMEs. Finally, higher costs of this kind can be covered by larger and more established companies, but potentially serve as
a bias against SMEs and work against most governments’ explicit policies in favor of SME involvement in the renewable energy sector.
However, the large number of investors and community trusts involved in the REIPPP is an indication that opportunities have been
made available to new players. SME’s were brought in by bigger companies as minority shareholders on a number of the bids. Also, the
entire Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  program has created multiple opportunities for SMEs in the form of advisory services, economic and social development
consultants and construction contractors. The parallel, small projects IPP procurement is an attempt to do more than Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  to
encourage local SME involvement in the sector.
6.2.11 Program design risks going fo rward
Four kinds of program design risk may create problems in the future:
•	 Delivery failure. The first dimension involves the possibility that the economic development requirements will not deliver expected
results. In particular, support for new South African industries aimed at the production of renewable energy components will face
challenges in a global industry already affected by over-supply and severe competition. Job growth resulting from such requirements
may not be sustainable in the long term and is likely to result in higher costs for power than would have been the case without the
requirements. Finally, local communities may see fewer real financial or economic benefits from local projects than they expect. This
inevitably leads to disappointment with and confusion about the community development aspects of the economic development
requirements. Each project is expected to invest at least one percent of revenues in community development, but few project developers
have experience in designing effective programs. Furthermore, the benefits that should accrue through local community shareholding will
take time to be realized: shareholder loans will first need to be repaid. In general, an inability of Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  to deliver in these areas could
result in local community dissatisfaction. It could also highlight, at a national level, the relatively higher costs of some of the renewable
energy supply technologies, leading to questions about the wisdom of pursuing these energy alternatives and potentially undermining
the overall political support for the program.
•	 Failure to monitor/manage. A second, related dimension of risk involves the possibility that the economic development activities will
not be appropriately monitored or managed by the government over the life of the contracts. Several notable examples exist of agencies
responsible for monitoring local content performance in developed countries, which have struggled to adequately perform their tasks
despite having considerable numbers of professional staff (WTI, 2013). After the first three rounds of bidding, the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  had generated 64 separate IPP contracts, each with a lifespan of 20 years, each involving commitments to as many as 17 economic development
targets, each reporting performance on a quarterly basis. As described above in Sect. 5.1, this reporting in turn will be used to calculate
performance deductions or credits, as well as termination points. In the cases of termination points, contractor rectification programs
must be reviewed in most cases, and dispute resolution is likely to be needed in some cases. The standard Implementation Agreement
makes vague mention of the fact that DOE reserves the right to hire “Economic Development Independent Monitors” who may be
recruited in some cases to help DOE confirm contractor compliance. But without a substantial number of permanent professional
staff and an ongoing government budget allocation to cover performance monitoring and evaluation costs, it is difficult to see how this
monitoring work can be sustained at an appropriate level.
•	 Transmission constraints and deemed energy payments. It is becoming apparent that Eskom’s transmission planning has lagged,
or has not been synchronized with, the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  award of new generation projects. There is a risk that some completed renewable
energy projects may not be able to connect to the grid in a timely fashion. The problem is generally not the shallow connections (i.e.,
the transmission connections to the nearest substations that most developers are funding or constructing themselves), but rather the
deep connection investments that Eskom needs to make to strengthen the transmission backbone to evacuate all the new energy that
is generated in these remote areas. In these cases, Eskom as the off-taker will be liable for deemed energy payments, even though no
electricity is being fed into the grid. These situations could lead to reputational risks for Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program .
•	 The single-buyer role of Eskom. This is a topic that has been at the center of a fierce debate in South Africa for over a decade, and
a complete discussion of it is beyond the scope of this paper. Critics have argued that the utility has been mismanaged and is now
in significant financial distress. A solution long promoted by the international development community is to break up the utility
by unbundling its key functions into generation, transmission, and distribution companies, some or all of which can eventually be
privatized. Eskom’s possible future circumstances present obvious risks to a program like Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program . If Eskom’s financial health continues
to deteriorate, the government’s sovereign guarantee may have to be called on to pay IPPs. In turn, that could affect the government’s
credit standing. If Eskom were eventually unbundled, a successor entity would presumably inherit the PPA contracts (and sovereign
guarantees). The credit worthiness of any such successor would be of critical concern to the national government and IPPs alike. At the
moment, the prevailing view in government seems to be that Eskom should continue as is – as the state-owned national monopoly utility
that acts as a single-buyer of power for distribution to rate payers. But, if that view begins to change, it will have implications for the
future of Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program .
6.3 Market factors
6.3.1 Global supply and demand of renewable energy
6.3.2 Donor and Multilateral Development Bank support fo r renewables
The public policy aspects of renewable energy, particularly the perceived need to use it in mitigating climate change, have generated
interest in renewable energy among members of the international donor community, including bi-lateral donor agencies and multi-lateral
development banks. Even though renewable energy generation is already a worldwide commercial industry, in some cases this interest on
the part of donors and DFIs translates into the willingness to use grants, concessional finance or innovative financial instruments to promote
the expanded use of renewable energy. Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  benefited to an extent from early-stage donor funding of technical assistance, as well as
the involvement by DFIs (e.g., the IFC) as project financiers. Donors and DFIs have also discussed the idea of issuing bonds to help with the refinancing of existing Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  project debt, and the creation of donor-capitalized facilities to provide subsidized transaction support and
project credit enhancements. In early 2014, the South African government issued a tender to design and structure a fund that would facilitate
DFI participation in future Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  windows. More DFI funding probably will be needed for BEE and community ownership in future rounds.
6.3.3 The South African banking secto r
The country’s banking sector has also played a large role in the success of the program. This sector is the largest, deepest, and most
sophisticated in Africa. It is highly liquid, offers long-term debt (15 to17 years for Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  projects), understands project finance, and has
experience with PPPs and private finance of public infrastructure. The sector also includes a small, but functioning secondary market in
bonds and syndicated paper. While the industry is perceived to be conservative and expensive, it has been essential in helping Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program 
achieve so many closed transactions in a relatively short period of time.
6.3.4 Other advisory services
South Africa also has a relatively wide array of other kinds of sophisticated advisory services needed for Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program  projects, including legal
firms and technical consultants (and also burgeoning economic and social development advisors) available to help with the design and
implementation of competitive bids. These services were essential for the success of Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program , but were stretched to the limit by the size of
the program.21

Stakeholders’ satisfaction as a key determinant of critical success factors in renewable energy projects,"Renewable energy projects (REPs) are critical to providing a clean and sustainable environmental perspective alongside the economic prosperity of any country. Unfortunately, recent trends in renewable energy projects (REPs) are not positive enough regarding their successful completion within the budgeted cost, planned time, proposed quality, and other necessary constraints. Although the pertinent literature has discussed the critical success factors (CSFs) for such projects, their influencing mechanism with respect to the role of key stakeholders is still overlooked. This study recognizes several critical success factors (CSFs) and their influencing mechanisms onto renewable energy projects (REPs) in order to evaluate direct influences onto project success as well as indirect influences through stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) as mediation on the project success of small and medium-sized renewable energy projects (REPs) in Pakistan’s energy sector. A sample of about 272 respondents working with renewable energy projects (REPs), including key stakeholders, has been collected to perform data analysis and draw inferences. A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used for data analysis and inference drawing. The results show that though there is a positive and direct association between critical success factors (CSFs) and project success, a partial mediating role of stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) between CSFs and project success was still determined. Hence, it was found that CSFs significantly contribute to renewable energy projects (REPs) through mediating influences of stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS). The findings confirmed that stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) is a key determinant for critical success factors (CSFs) in renewable energy projects (REPs). Moreover, stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) emerged to be a crucial element for the completion of such projects. The empirical findings of this study might have a useful effect on academicians and the practitioners engaged with renewable energy projects (REPs).
In this study, our results support the linkages among CSFs and project success (PS). The empirical findings of the current research indicated that CSFs are those fac- tors that increase the success of the REPs. Moreover, stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) as a mediating variable plays a vital role in boosting the actual success of the project in the RE industry. This study advances the de- bate on numerous success factors and identifies five sig- nificant CSFs, i.e., communication factor (CF), team factors (TF), technical factors (Tech.F), organizational factors (OF), and environmental factors (EF). These five factors had been identified on the basis of some current and prior studies, as well as the survey interview with project specialists, i.e., project directors, project man- agers, and project team leaders of REPs. Moreover, on the basis of previous studies, the authors clearly identi- fied stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) as a mediating vari- able in this study. The model and theoretical concept of this study showed that the CSFs had affected the project success (PS) by using stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) as a mediating variable, which is a novel contribution in the context of renewable energy projects (REPs). This is the first and only research, which applies the impact of CSFs on stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) and project success in REPs. The outcomes of the current research report allowed for providing a solid comprehension toward a distinguishing proof of critical success factors (CSFs) and their relationship with the achievement of the REPs. The study makes some mandatory contributions. It (1) distinguishes the significant success factors (SSFs) for REPs extends in pertinent literature; (2) classes the SSFs into five CSFs clusters; i.e., communication factors (CF), team factors (TF), technical factors (Tech.F), organizational factors (OF), and environmental factors (EF); (3) affirms a comprehensive framework that envelops the pertinent CSFs to cultivate project achievement in the form of stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS), noticed as the first time in the literature of sustainable power source projects; (4) initiates the discourse and directs the route to the re-elucidation of project success (PS) in the pertinent literature, as indicated by projects operational performance. Success, not exclusively to the activities yet to the association taking a shot at sustainable power source projects itself can be build up on the CSFs for those who are required to predict the intended outcomes in renewable energy investments.
Our results confirmed the theoretical prediction that CSFs have a positive and significant effect on the success of REPs. The literature on CSFs was adequately used to demonstrate how construction organizations can effi- ciently use CSFs to increase project success (PS). More- over, the proposed hypotheses have also confirmed that CSFs have a significant association with the success of REPs, and stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) mediates in the relationship between CSFs and project success (PS). Thus, the CSFs were found to be dynamical for project success (PS), where stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS) being a significant component to create the connection among critical success factors (CSFs) and project success (PS). It was clearly shown that project success (PS) in renew- able energy projects (REPs) can only be achieved through project stakeholders’ satisfaction (SS). These empirical findings have useful implications for academi- cians and practitioners. This research will help project- oriented organizations in weighing the CSFs from differ- ent perspectives that have not yet been discussed. In the future, such kinds of research should be cautiously car- ried out at an international level and be applied to en- sure performance in other relevant sustainable projects besides renewable energy projects (REPs). Likewise, the current study is based upon the project team members’
perceptions with regard to the given success factors. A future research with an experimental technique should be encouraged for comparing its results with the results of the current work to better understand the CSFs in REPs.","Energy, Sustainability and Society",,
Status and perspectives of renewable energy policy and deployment in the European Union—What is needed to reach the 2020 targets?,"This article evaluates the status of current RES deployment, policies and barriers in the EU-27 member states and compares it to the required to meet the 2020 targets. The evaluation relies strongly on the quantitative deployment status and policy effectiveness indicators. European RES deployment and policy has progressed strongly in recent years, but the growth here has been mainly driven by effective policies in a small or medium number of top runner countries. Across Europe, the highest average policy effectiveness over six years was reached for onshore wind (4.2%), biofuels (3.6%) and biomass electricity (2.7%), while in the heat sector, all technologies score below 2%. Comparing the recent progress to the required growth for meeting the 2020 target, it appears that some countries largely exceed the interim targets of the RES Directive 2009/28/EC. Despite this, Europe will need additional policy effort to reach the 2020 target. Critical success factors include implementing effective and efficient policies that attract sufficient investments, reducing administrative and grid related barriers, especially in currently less advanced countries, upgrading the power grid infrastructure, dismantling financial barriers in the heat sector, realising sustainability standards for biomass, and lowering energy demand through increased energy efficiency efforts. This article analysed the recent progress in RES deployment and policy in the European member states using aggregated deployment status and policy effectiveness indicators and combining European statistics and country-specific data.

Marked progress has been made in European RES deployment and policy over the last few years. The RES-E sector has grown rapidly, mainly due to the mature but still evolving technologies of onshore wind and biomass electricity. Biodiesel in transport has also experienced high growth rates. In contrast, RES growth in the heat sector was rather moderate, possibly also due to the absence of a specific EU legislation for RES-H until 2009. Small-scale, wood-based biomass applications were the dominant technology for heat. The market growth in all the sectors has been mainly driven by effective policies in a small or medium number of top runner countries. The top runners with the highest deployment status and policy effectiveness differ for each technology. Still, even though all EU-27 member states have RES policies in place, many countries have a very low policy effectiveness and deployment status for almost all RET.

RET support policies focus strongly on removing financial barriers in order to force RET entry into the energy markets. As previous analyses have shown, the success factors for an effective and efficient support policy design include policy stability, the reduction of project risks, a stable financing source independent of the state budget, and a regular adjustment of support conditions to market progress. At the same time, success is often also determined by non-economic factors, particularly the removal of administrative and legal barriers, e.g. for permitting and grid access. Best practice examples from different countries show that these barriers can be successfully dismantled. Growth-related barriers that have evolved in recent years in more advanced markets pose a greater challenge, e.g. infrastructural barriers and curtailment in the power sector.

Comparing the recent progress in RES deployment to the required to meet the European target of 20% RES in gross final energy in 2020 shows that Europe will need to make additional policy efforts, but that this seems manageable. According to the NREAPs, 15 member states are even planning to over-achieve their national 2020 target, but it is not yet fully clear which policy strategy they will employ to do so. Our quantitative analysis indicated that the majority of member states are on track to achieve the interim trajectory provided by the RES directive, which allows for moderate RES growth until the last two years before 2020. In order to achieve the higher growth rates required by the end of the target period, the majority of member states will need to enhance their policy effectiveness, and close the gap to the top runner countries. This seems even more important as some top runners may well struggle to maintain their RES growth under the evolving growth-related barriers. While it is true that member states propose additional policy actions in their NREAPs, it remains doubtful whether these will be sufficient to trigger the projected targeted growth.

Critical success factors for reaching the 2020 targets include the implementation of effective and efficient policies that promote high project success rates and attract sufficient investments, the reduction of administrative and grid-access barriers, especially in currently less advanced countries, upgrading the power grid infrastructure, dismantling financial barriers to RET in the heat sector, e.g. through budgetary-independent support instruments, the proper implementation and possible extension of sustainability standards for biomass, and – last but not least – the reduction of energy demand through increased energy efficiency policy efforts. While comparing the projected RES growth with achieved growth rates and effectiveness indicator scores can help to gauge whether the 2020 RES target will be reached, they are not suitable indicators for assessing future RES market barriers and growth rates. From the qualitative discussion in Section 4, the following success and fail factors can be derived for the 2020 pathway described in the NREAPs:
•
Effective policies to overcome the existing financial barriers are needed across Europe, not only in top runner countries. To attract sufficient capital, the support schemes should limit RES project risks and promote high success rates for projects under development: if too few projects are supported, there will not be enough investment in early stage project development. On the other hand, consumer expenditures per unit of energy need to be minimised as far as possible in order to maintain public acceptance of RES support.

•
The assessment showed that administrative and grid-access barriers, which are hindering the market uptake of RET in many countries, are among the biggest obstacles to faster RES growth across Europe. In principle, it is in the hands of policy makers to significantly lower such barriers, and it does seem possible to do so within the next decade.

•
On the other hand, growth-related barriers have evolved that threaten continued RET development, particularly the required power grid extensions that mainly affect wind power growth, but increasingly also other technologies. Current top runner countries in terms of RET deployment status may be hardest hit by such barriers. Upgrading the power grid infrastructure requires massive investments and legal measures to speed up the process.

•
For offshore wind, which is supposed to contribute approx. 25% of the additional wind power capacity in the electricity sector, there is a clear gap between recent policy effectiveness and that required in the future. Tackling infrastructural challenges and investment risks is of particular importance here.

•
In the heat sector, steadier financial support and implementing support instruments which are independent of the state budget (e.g. effective use obligations as requested by the RES directive or incentives financed via heat fuel surcharges) could play a key role in overcoming the existing financial barriers.

•
Member states see biomass as playing a crucial role in all RES sectors, so the sustainability of the utilised potentials needs to be ensured both within and outside the EU. The sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids introduced in the RES directive are an important step in this direction, but they still need to be implemented across member states. Furthermore, the possible extension of the criteria remains an issue for the coming years (e.g. to cover indirect land-use changes or solid biomass; this issue cannot be dealt with here). At the same time, policy makers need to avoid creating new market barriers to biofuels during this process.

•
Energy efficiency is another crucial element for reaching the 2020 RES targets that has not been discussed so far. Limiting energy demand in all end-use sectors by employing effective energy efficiency policies decreases the required amount of RES, most notably in the heat sector. In the NREAPs, member states have also provided overall energy demand projections: these predict that final energy demand will drop slightly compared to current levels from 1214 Mtoe in 2008 (Eurostat, 2010b), to 1189 Mtoe in 2020 (NREAPs, 2011), mainly driven by the decreasing energy consumption of the largest energy consuming member states (Germany, France and the UK). Achieving these energy efficiency levels will also require additional energy efficiency policy efforts. Such additional efforts are required in any case in order to meet the EU energy efficiency target for 2020 (whether the NREAP demand projections are in line with the energy efficiency target requirements cannot be judged here).The member states with the largest energy consumption levels (Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Spain and Poland) have a special responsibility to meet both the European RES and energy efficiency targets as they are predicted to consume 67% of total final energy in the European Community in 2020.


Finally, it is important to understand that RET are no longer a niche market. According to EWEA (2010), more than 60% of the newly installed power capacity in Europe in 2009 already came from renewables. Furthermore, the 2020 target is only one milestone on the way to a considerably higher share of RES in the long term. The only post-2020 target set by the EU so far is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80–95% until 2050 compared to 1990 levels. To reach this target, the large majority of scenarios foresee very high shares (up to 100%) of RES in energy supply. While the bulk of RES final energy in 2020 will be produced by RET that are already close to the market in terms of costs, i.e. different types of biomass, wind energy, hydropower and heat pumps, other promising RET with currently higher costs (i.e. the different solar technologies, geothermal, tide and wave) need to be developed in time, i.e. partly before 2020. Similarly, energy infrastructures and market designs need to be preparing now for higher shares of RES beyond 2020.

"Subsea cable key challenges of an intercontinental power link: case
study of Australia–Singapore interconnector","The high potential for renewable energy generation in Australia, in particular solar and wind, and the high carbon content of Southeast Asian electricity and projected demand growth create favourable conditions for a HVDC power link between Australian and Southeast Asia. Such an interconnector would link predominantly solar farms located in northern Australia, known for its highest insolation levels in the world, to Singapore given its central location within Southeast Asia, high reli- ance on natural gas for its power generation, high demand growth and limited renewable potential and land surface. The current paper presents a holistic view of the key challenges of an Australia–Singapore power link related to its length, in the order of 3200 km, the water depth of sections crossing the Timor Trough and Indonesian waters, up to 1900 m, and the manufacturing and logistic issues of extensive length of cable to be deployed in a part of the world distant from the main manufacturing facilities. This very ambitious project will require a unique integrated contracting strategy involving multi- ple HVDC cable suppliers, marine heavy transport companies and cable installation contractors to effectively deliver this project within a sensible timeframe. Connecting Australia to Singapore through an HVDC subsea interconnector, although relatively ambitious, is technically feasible. A potentially suitable marine route has been identi- fied, 3200 km in length, which departs from north of West- ern Australia, crosses the Timor Trough (up to 1900 m water depth), crosses Indonesia (east of Bali) and runs through the Java Sea to Singapore. Adopting the current technology this interconnector can be configured in a bipolar mode to offer 2.4 GW power capacity, using two individual and identical 525 kV HVDC underwater cables, with most likely different designs along the route, such as copper and aluminium con- ductors for the shallow and deepwater sections respectively, and a mass-impregnated or XLPE insulation.
The closest analogues, to date, of the anticipated intercon- nector key characteristics are summarised in the Table 11.
This Australia—Singapore power link has the potential to offer valuable benefits, not only to both countries, but also to Southeast Asia collectively in the long term. It will enhance Singapore energy security and decrease its exclu- sive reliance on natural gas for power generation whilst contributing to reduce its carbon footprint. Rooftop solar is the only, and limited, renewable energy source avail- able to Singapore and a long interconnector is one of the few credible options to lower the country’s emission level. Besides, the Australian renewable industry will benefit from this megaproject by significantly strengthen its workforce skillset in the renewable sector which can be leveraged for subsequent large-scale renewable developments in north- west Australia including solar, wind and green hydrogen projects.
However, this study identified the following key chal- lenges that need to be overcome:
• HVDC cable supply: HVDC cable lead time and current worldwide plant production capacity is currently a major hindrance to the feasibility of this project. The required cable quantity (2 × 3200 km) exceeds the average annual plant capacity worldwide. Besides, this project will most likely be in competition with other HV projects (HVAC
and HVDC) to secure manufacturing slots. An in-depth appreciation of the HVDC cable market and individual cable manufacturing capability, respective strengths and weaknesses shall be undertaken in detail as well as planned/possible plant capacity expansion to define a robust procurement strategy, most likely involving mul- tiple simultaneous manufacturers.
• HVDC cable transport and installation: This inter- connector length combined with the remote installation location from manufacturing facilities create unique cable transportation challenges that can be technically addressed by chartering a fleet composed of heavy transport vessels ranging from HLVs, MCVs, semi-sub- mersible vessels and/or cargo barges. The installation/ transportation fleet selection will depend on the num- ber and locations of cable manufacturers, the level of desired schedule float between transportation fleet and installation fleet and associated risk profile whilst mini- mising capital expenditure. The interconnector construc- tion phase requires two cable lay vessels mobilised for a 2.5-year duration with a heavy transport vessel fleet continuously transiting between manufacturing facilities and Indonesian/Australian sheltered waters to feed the CLVs with cable sections.
• Route through Timor Trough: The marine route crosses the Timor Trough reaching 1900 m water depth with high seabed gradients. Specific attention will be required to the cable cross-section design to account for high lay tension during installation and hydrostatic pressure in service (up to 200 bar at this depth). The survey operations and route selection process are anticipated to require extensive engi- neering to address the challenges pose by possible mass flow slides from the region seismic activity, high seabed slopes and wide cable corridors required to enable future repair (Omega loop). High specification CLVs will be needed to enable safe cable deployment in this deep section.
• Indonesian territorial waters: Obviously, Indonesia will be a major stakeholder for this development, having most of the interconnector length crossing Indonesian territorial waters. Early engagement with authorities will be paramount to successfully and timely secure approval, of the Permit in Principle enabling cable installation
within the country jurisdiction.
• Seabed congestion between Indonesia and Singapore:
The route section from Indonesia to Singapore is excep- tionally shallow and flat with a high level of seabed con- gestion. Many crossings with existing pipelines and com- munication cables are expected with a need to protect the link against damage from fishing activities, ship dragged anchors and dropped objects, most likely requiring the cables to be trenched over 60% of the cable route.
The capital expenditure of this subsea interconnector pro- ject is anticipated to reach $6 billion and is mainly driven by the HVDC cable supply cost; the cable transportation represents only a small fraction of the overall project budget. However, the schedule risk profile of the complex project logistic is relatively high as it can impact the cable laying operations for which expensive spreads will be mobilised.
From project planning and financing perspectives, a staged development approach with an initial monopolar link between Australia and Indonesia appears attractive in light of the scale of the project and installation cam- paign duration. The tri-party power link model is currently being implemented by the EuroAsia interconnector project between Israel, Cyprus and Greece, which is, at the time of writing, the closest HVDC project analogue. The benefits for Indonesia include a carbon content reduction of its electric- ity and a response to the expected high demand growth in the coming decades. Also, Indonesia has the world’s second largest geothermal energy resource (after Iceland) and it is expected that its share of clean electricity from geothermal generation will grow significantly in the future.",Energy Transitions,,
Success and failure in the political economy of solar electrification: Lessons from World Bank Solar Home System (SHS) projects in Sri Lanka and Indonesia,"This study contrasts two national solar home system (SHS) programs that relied on the same World Bank approach, but reached dramatically different results. The Energy Services Delivery Project (ESDP) in Sri Lanka was an exemplary renewable energy access program, successfully installing 21,000 off-grid SHSs alongside grid-connected mini-hydro capacity and off-grid village hydroelectric systems. It reached all of its targets ahead of schedule and below cost. By contrast, the Indonesia Solar Home System Project (ISHSP), which ran from 1997 to 2003, sought to reach one million rural Indonesians through the sales and installation of 200,000 SHSs. However, by project closing in 2003, less than five percent of the original sales target, or only 8054 units, had been installed. The ESDP and ISHSP were the World Bank's first foray into a “market-based renewable energy services provision model.” Based on original research interviews and field observation, the article finds that contrasting the two programs—one a success, the other a failure—offers lessons for energy and development practitioners, namely that effective programs are those that select appropriate technology, often with input from households themselves; they promote community participation and ownership; and they have robust marketing, demonstration, and promotion activities. The political economy of solar success: Sri Lanka
As this section of the paper argues, that the ESDP was a success is practically incontrovertible (Sovacool, 2013b). It exceeded every one of its targets, ahead of schedule, and below cost, achievements summarized in Table 3. It connected 16 micro-hydro plants to the national grid, served 22,685 off-grid households, built the wind farm, and met all of its energy efficiency goals (World Bank, 2003, United Nations Development Program, 2012). Project documents estimated savings of 140,000 t of carbon dioxide equivalent at an incremental cost of $52 per ton; in actuality, 514,000 t were displaced at a cost below $19 per ton. Given the focus of this comparative study, the remainder of this subsection will focus exclusively on the SHS component. At the close of the project, Sri Lanka was home to a vibrant industry of suppliers, developers, consultants, and trainers in the renewable energy sector, with 4 major solar companies compared to 2 at the start, and 15 developers compared to 2 at the start. Eighty service centers existed compared to less than 10 at the start. Although the program started with dependence on Nepali technology, by its end Sri Lankan manufacturing had reached the point where they were exporting systems to overseas markets in Asia and Africa. DFCC Bank, the Administrative Unit (AU), was approached in December 2002 to distribute an additional 6000 SHS outside of the project's scope. As one respondent proclaimed, “ESDP has had a lasting, positive mark on the renewable energy industry in Sri Lanka – it laid the entire foundation, caused a complete shift in the country's energy planning.” And here's the kicker: it achieved all of these benefits below cost, budgeted for $55.2 million but spending only $44.5 million—savings that resulted from a combination of the creation of economies of scale, technological learning, and capacity building.

The next three subsections focus inductively on three of the most significant benefits from the solar component to the EFSD: accelerated household adoption, income generation, and the improvement of industry technical standards and training.

4.1. Accelerated diffusion of solar home systems
At the peak of the SHS subcomponent, after SEEDs became a PCI more than 1300 systems were being sold each month, and four major vendors—Shell Solar, Access Solar, SELCO, and Alpha Thermal—established national networks. Only a few systems were sold nationwide in 1998, but almost 20,000 had been sold by 2001. Planners realized that as areas became “saturated” with SHS units vendors tended to close their shops and move to provinces where demand was “fresh,” essentially leaving no dedicated maintenance support facilities.

The ESDP therefore supported the creation of 80 permanent service and distribution centers with $5 million invested from the private sector. Over the duration of the ESDP, overall employment in the industry jumped from 50 to 1500, and a Social Industry Association was established. As the owner of one major solar distributor noted, “Before the ESDP, we were selling 5 or 6 systems per month in town areas, not rural areas, and we had one branch office in Colombo; now, we’re installing 40–50 systems per month, mostly in rural areas throughout five branches.”

Table 4 shows that most of these systems ended up being 20–40 Wp (32%) and 40–60 Wp (59%), and the subcomponent had a tiered subsidy which gave larger disbursements for smaller, less expensive systems. As Fig. 2 shows, total installed capacity jumped from practically zero MWp in 1999 to almost 1 MWp in 2002 when the ESDP ended, growing to a staggering 5.5 MWp in 2008 (when sales started to plateau) with an annual turnover of $40 million. The program also saw the costs of SHS decline, from $11 per Wp in 1998 to slightly less than $10 per Wp in 2002.
4.2. Community energy and income generation
Rising community incomes, and potent participation from local banks and villages in the ESDP, is also a testament to its success. Over the course of the project, PCIs contributed $16 million of their own funds, several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were operating in tandem with the ESDP project areas, and more than 30 villages were asking for solar or micro-hydro systems (World Bank, 2003). As one bank manager told us, “we weren’t participating out of any sense of charity, we were driven by commercial viability.” Members of the AU also told the research team that “no major complaints” had ever arisen regarding the SHS and grid-connected components.

Indeed, an extensive survey done by the World Bank at the close of the project found that energy access through the ESDP promoted income generating activities, increased community safety, facilitated longer studying hours, and prompted a variety of other activities shown in Fig. 3. SHS units, for example, cost only $750 over ten years at that time, including battery replacement, but many rural homes spend $650 per year on kerosene and automotive batteries—meaning units paid for themselves quite quickly. Many of these benefits were confirmed by an independent, follow-up study by the United Nations Development Program (2012). That study found that SHS reduced kerosene consumption even more from 11 l to 0.7 l, and eliminated expenditures on charging batteries in 93% of households. Moreover, 50–90% of households surveyed stated that access to electricity from SHS provided better lighting, led to longer studying hours, a greater sense of safety and security, and facilitated the introduction of televisions. electric irons, radios and mobile phones.

4.3. Industrial technical standards and effective sales techniques
Though perhaps more difficult to measure than the other components, the ESDP strengthened capacity in a variety of ways. For the SHS subcomponent, the ESDP supported the design and enforcement of technical specifications for SHS and also trained technicians to conduct spot checks, develop after sales service models, and provide customers a way to lodge complaints.

Part of what drove such high sales and satisfaction levels were new sales techniques developed and perfected with technical assistance from the ESDP. One was displaying products to large groups of people rather than individuals; vendors and PCIs sent speakers with units to garment factories, schools, and hospitals, giving demonstrations and/or answering questions during lunch breaks or between shifts. Another was innovative displays: as one respondent put it, “our rural salespeople went and fixed SHS in temples, churches, and community centers so people could literally see what they could do.” Another was door to door visits for SHS done at night, so people could see firsthand what rechargeable torches and electric lights can offer them. A fourth was dealers traveling by motorbike to loan sample systems for a single night so households could become familiar with solar electricity. A fifth was targeting women as beneficiaries since household surveys revealed that electricity access benefitted them the most—as it enabled labor saving appliances, reduced household chores, provided access to entertainment, and positively impacted family routines. A sixth was sending along bank officers with the technicians doing demonstrations so interested community members could sign up on the spot.",Energy Policy,,
Success Factors for the Implementation of Community Renewable Energy in Thailand,"Community renewable energy (Community Renewable Energy ) has recently been proposed as one of the effective policy tools to make a community sustainable and to strengthen this association. Community Renewable Energy  is, however, not widespread yet in Thailand, and evidence-based research on Community Renewable Energy  in the country is rather scarce. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of Community Renewable Energy  in Thailand to identify the key factors affecting its implementation. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and document analysis for 26 active Community Renewable Energy  projects in Thailand. Results show that the characteristics of Community Renewable Energy  in Thailand are rooted in the geographical location of a community. A legal structure was created from a pre-existing group to implement a Community Renewable Energy  project. The primary motivation for implementing Community Renewable Energy  is sustainable development of a community. We examined essential factors separated into two groups—internal and external factors—in reference to Community Renewable Energy  in developed nations. We highlight several issues concerning the further development of Community Renewable Energy  in Thailand. First, a strong group leader and a formal structure are essential to drive and manage a project. Second, networks of Community Renewable Energy  projects and long-term revolving funds are crucial external support to implement Community Renewable Energy . The characteristics and success factors for the implementation of the selected 26 Community Renewable Energy  projects in Thailand are analyzed. Results reveal that (i) Community Renewable Energy  implementation is rooted in geographically bound communities; (ii) a pre-existing group and its legal structure in communities play an essential role in carrying out Community Renewable Energy ; (iii) the primary motivation for Community Renewable Energy  employment is sustainable development, which focuses on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions; (iv) the internal success factors are intention and vision, human resources, management skills, and community participation, while the external success factors are RE potential, mature technology, financial support, appropriate consultation, and support from the national and local government. It is strongly suggested that external factors, such as financial policy and network support, should be promoted to further facilitate Community Renewable Energy  implementation.
Our finding addresses the lack of a comprehensive view on implementing Community Renewable Energy  projects in Thailand. Further research is necessary to understand the significant factors influencing Community Renewable Energy  implementation in developing countries. The results show that the formation of a Community Renewable Energy ’s group and the existence of external support contribute to the successful implementation of Community Renewable Energy  in Thailand. The characteristics of Thai communities make it easier to formulate groups due to their collectivist mentality and commitment to the traditional roles of each member. However, the formation of a formal organization is necessary as it provides the structure and rules that enable the community to manage the project as a business. Support from the academe helps less experienced Community Renewable Energy s by providing technical and financial knowledge. On the other hand, the government provides financial support to implement the projects since most communities have low income.
4.1. Characteristics of the Community
Thai farmers with a collectivist culture have a tendency to build long-term relationships and trust, which leads to a shared intention and vision. Their commitment to traditional roles leads to everyone having their own rightful place in society, which fosters community participation in maintaining society. Hofstede reported that Thai cultures exhibit a high power distance and tend to be low on individualism [35,36]. Furthermore, these two cultural dimensions (power distance and individualism) relate to the culture of agricultural communities in Thailand because of the kinship principles, which serve as the basic foundation for working together (e.g., rice planting and harvesting are organized around kinship and close friends). Although some traditional agricultural societies are gradually shifting to the agroindustry, collectivist farming vastly remains in Thailand. Thus, Thai agricultural communities can still be considered collectivistic and traditional. Hence, these characteristics lead to (1) effortless formation of groups, (2) willingness to accept help from others, and (3) intention to take leadership roles. However, a strong group leader is needed to drive the project’s success.
In the UK, internal and vision (4%) and community participation (5%) were also identified as success factors, but the percentage was relatively low, suggesting a low impact [17]. In contrast to Thailand’s collectivism and commitment to traditional roles, the UK’s society is more individualistic and competitive [35,36], which explains the low importance placed on a group’s effort. Community spirit and sense of locality and responsibility were also identified as success factors for the community-level project in the Samso Renewable Energy Island, Denmark [13]. Moreover, the longevity of the local people’s group was identified as a successful social factor in Scotland [21]. This shows that community participation and intention and vision are important despite the difference in culture.
4.2. Characteristics of the Group Structure
Since Thai culture is fundamentally rooted in a kinship society [37], it tends to have unclear business practices, which necessitate a formal structure. On the other hand, individualism in the UK also requires a formal structure to initiate a business. We found that a legitimate organizational structure leads to a successful implementation of Community Renewable Energy , as mentioned in Section 3.1.1. The activity of forming a legal structure sometimes strengthens a group as it provides the opportunity to (1) gather the necessary people with skills needed by a project, (2) establish the rules of an organization, and (3) clarify the duty of members. The legal organization establishes good governance to manage its activities, such as account auditing, annual tax payment, and collective decision making. The results showed that 69% of the total Community Renewable Energy  projects (18 projects) had a formal structure before implementing Community Renewable Energy , as shown in Figure 2b. A study in the UK also reported that 65% of the total respondents (354 projects) had a formal structure [17]. In the Thai case, the MOEN required a community to form a legal entity in a project’s final application. As a result of forming a formal organization, Community Renewable Energy  gained human resources and management skills, which are necessary to manage a project.
4.3. Knowledge Support
Community Renewable Energy s in Thailand need technical and financial consultation since this kind of project only started in 2013 with support from the MOEN. Communities still do not have the necessary knowledge to implement a project. The MOEN has just implemented a trial of a Community Renewable Energy  subsidy program from 2013 to 2016, which suggests that the program is still young. As the MOEN aims at helping agricultural communities to develop Community Renewable Energy , it recognizes that these communities do not have the necessary knowledge about renewable energy. With this in mind, the MOEN has dispatched academic consultants to help communities to develop a Community Renewable Energy  project. Initially, the MOEN only contacted Chiang Mai University, and the university used its network to establish a consultation network to support communities in other regions in Thailand.
Despite the efforts of the consultation network, only five universities supported communities across the country due to the limited number of academic organizations in Thailand. It will be tough to support communities once the number of Community Renewable Energy s increases in the future. Therefore, there is a need to increase network support. In the UK and Denmark cases, people involved in a project can support each other due to the strong network among Community Renewable Energy s and other organizations, such as local authorities, business entities, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations [13,17]. The study in the UK reported that the average networking of Community Renewable Energy  was 2.7 partners per operative project in partnership with other organizations [17], while in the Thai case, it was only 1.15 partners per operative project, as mentioned in Section 3.1.1. In the case of the Samso Renewable Energy Island, Denmark, a strong network with entrepreneurial individuals was identified to effectively support the island’s search for new opportunities for Community Renewable Energy  development [13]. Therefore, to promote Community Renewable Energy  in Thailand, we suggest that the Thai government or academia help Community Renewable Energy  groups create network support among Community Renewable Energy  groups. For example, organizing more AAR activities can create a network among Community Renewable Energy  projects.
4.4. Financial Support
The participants in the projects are from agricultural sectors that have low income, and most of them need financial support. Actually, 26 Community Renewable Energy  projects were implemented with financial support from the government. The project size ranged from USD 3000 to USD 160,000 and USD 40,000 on average per project [9]. With 30%–70% subsidy, each project got around USD 28,000. With a farmer’s household net income of about USD 2128 per year in 2017 [38], it is insufficient for members to implement a project only with their incomes. This shows the importance of financial support for the success of a project.
Despite the success of these projects, financial support is limited to that of the MOEN, since only 15% of the participants were successful in borrowing money from financial institutions, as explained in Section 3.2.2. These factors show the limited financial institutes that provide loan for Community Renewable Energy  implementation in the country. The Thai government is not entirely decentralized, and as a result, there is minimal local financial autonomy to support Community Renewable Energy . There is a limited grant from the MOEN available for Community Renewable Energy  implementation. Moreover, a few soft loans are available for a community to implement a project.
In the UK case, however, since the local government is decentralized, it can directly help Community Renewable Energy  projects. Moreover, the UK government created a novel funding mechanism called “Big Society Capital” in 2012 to provide the social sector with affordable financing and build a market for a social investment of social purpose enterprises that expect a social or financial return on investment [17,39]. At the same time, it has a sufficient number of financial institutions that support local activities, with the number of banks totaling about 300 [40]. Thus, the chance to obtain financial support from a bank in the UK is high, which could have led to a significant number of Community Renewable Energy  projects in the UK. In contrast, there are only 30 banks in Thailand [41]. Among these small financial institutions, only a few of them provide loans to communities because projects require a low-interest rate. Therefore, the government should establish long-term financial support for Community Renewable Energy . For example, a long-term revolving fund should be created for Community Renewable Energy  implementation in Thailand. It is feasible because Thailand already has a revolving fund for the private sector to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects [42].",energies,,
Success of renewable energy projects under the financial and non‐financial performance measures.,"Around the globe, investment in renewable energy projects has been increased significantly since the last decade. However, recent trends of completed renewable energy projects are not positive enough regarding the significantly contributing through their operational performance. This study is an attempt to figure out the role of financial and non‐financial measures for the performance of renewable energy projects. A sample of 272x respondents was collected from the key project personnel in a view to assessing the influencing mechanisms of financial and non‐financial performance measures toward success in renewable energy projects. The data was collected through a convenient survey method from the employees working on managerial and technical positions in the small and medium‐sized renewable energy projects in Pakistan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to perform data analysis and draw inferences. It was found that the success of renewable energy projects is largely depending on the influences of both financial and non‐financial performance measures. Moreover, both the financial and non‐financial performance measures were also found to be interlinked with each other positively and significantly. In addition, the role of financial performance measure compares to non‐financial performance measure was found to be more significant while contributing toward project success in renewable energy projects. The results also show that both the financial and non‐financial performance measures function as complements instead of substitute, while contributing toward renewable energy project success. Despite the role of financial measure is higher in contributing to project success as compare to non‐financial performance measure, ultimately both measures are necessary for sustainable project success in renewable energy projects. The research findings provide new insights for governments, policymakers, investors, and key stakeholders working on renewable energy projects to understand the measures driving better performance in such projects, alongside adding a knowledge base for future researchers and practitioners.In this study, our results support the linkages among financial and non‐financial performance measures, and project success. The empirical findings of current research indicating that financial and non‐financial performance measures are those factors that increase the success of renewable energy projects. Although both the financial and non‐financial performance measures are affecting the project success, however, the financial performance compares to non‐performance measure were contributing more toward project success. Moreover, it has been also observed that both the financial and non‐financial functions as complements instead of substitutes while contributing to project success. So, we can say with the confidence that success in renewable energy projects can only be achieved through projects' financial and non‐financial performance measures. This is first and only research which applies the impact of financial and non‐financial performance measures on the project success in renewable energy projects.

These empirical findings have useful implications for academicians and practitioners. The current study has filled the gap of the literature, for practitioners, this research will help the project‐oriented organizations in weighing the financial and non‐financial performance measures from the different perspectives that have not been discussed before. Particular in Pakistan the renewable project is still in the developing stage, this study will help the project‐oriented organizations in Pakistan to adopt those financial and non‐financial performance measures which enhance the success of the renewable projects. Indeed, our results cover the way of constructive decision making in choosing the appropriate project (where the success can be ensured through financial and non‐financial performance measures) and in strengthening the aforementioned measures in constructing the renewable energy projects. Compatible and compelling techniques framed on those acknowledged financial and non‐financial performance measures can likewise be shaped for effectively ensuring the future of RE projects for enhanced development.",Sustainable Development,,
Successful transformational change in revenue management among beneficiary communities of South African renewable energy construction companies,"Transformational change is the second of three sub-models that resulted from the splitting of the original model following the data analysis as part of a thesis entitled A theoretical model for successful management of revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa. The sub-model provides specific guidance for project managers dealing with transformational change in communities to stakeholders, industry experts and community development practitioners in the renewable energy sector. The aim of the research was to promote a localised understanding of education, social interaction, social cohesion, infrastructure improvement and sharing to ensure success in managing the revenue for beneficiary community projects by renewable energy construction companies. A literature review of relevant literature on transfor mational change factors was conducted and used to develop a structured questionnaire distributed to national and international popu lation of project management practitioners who were conveniently sampled in South Africa. Using an electronic measuring instrument, the empirical findings established four factors that were reliable and valid for transformational change in communities, namely education, infrastructure development, human develop-ment, and change management. Using these factors and construc ting a path diagram of the indepen dent variables (education, infrastructure develop ment, human development, change management) and subsequent intervening (good governance) and dependent variables (perceived success of revenue management), appropriate hypotheses were developed to test the model. The hypotheses were analysed and tested empirically using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Determinants were identified as elements of transformational change that influence the success of revenue management for beneficiary communities for South African renewable energy companies. These included the use of education, infrastructure development, human development, change management, and good governance. The  independent  variables  associated  with  this  sub-model  include  developmental  benefits  and  human  development,  and  the inter  vening  variable  was  good  governance, which  alludes  to  a  transformational approach to revenue management for beneficiary communities. Therefore, every kind of participation referred to in sub-model  A  (multi-sector  participation)  must  complement  Sub-model  –  Transformational  change  and  have  a  deliberate  component  of  knowledge  (education)  and  skills  transfer  so  that  beneficiary communities can take ownership of, and be responsible for growth and development. There must be greater participation on the part of government and the IPPs during the implementation of community projects to ensure that outcomes for the beneficiary communities are transformational in  nature.  The  role  of  the  intervening  variable,  good  governance,  must also form an integral part of project management to ensure that transformational change benefits the beneficiary community at all times and in every possible way. Project management, especially during the construction phase, must include activities such as:• Addressing human development needs as a priority.• Prior  to  construction  of  the  renewable  energy  facility,  gain  baseline knowledge and insight regarding the educational and infrastructural needs of the beneficiary communities (including engagement with the community at grassroots level).• Scenario forecasting.• Appointing internal and external service providers.• Forming possible PPPs or collaborating with other IPPs.• Managing finances and financial transactions.• Monitoring, evaluating and reporting all activities.• Include policies and procedures in all project management processes.It is now known from the most recent literature available (DoE, 2015) that  the  quantum  of  the  socio-economic  development,  enterprise  development and community trust to be spent over the next 20 to 25  years  in  South  Africa  in  the  renewable  energy  sector  as  part  of  the REIPPP Program is over R50 billion. The renewable energy sector has  the  opportunity  to  use  these  funds  to  make  a  transformational  change in the beneficiary communities and, ultimately, in the overall economy of South Africa",Acta Structilia,,
Sustainability assessment of integrated forest biorefinery implemented in Canadian pulp and paper mills,"To overcome declining markets and low-cost competition, the integrated forest biorefinery (IFBR) business model has received a lot of attention from the pulp and paper (P&P) sector. This article deals with sustainability assessment of IFBR implemented in P&P mills for bioenergy production. The objective is to develop a mathematically-based approach, for decision makers within the forest sector, that aims to optimize the sustainability of the IFBR value creation network. A multi-objective optimization model, applied to a Canadian case study and integrating environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), is developed. The life cycle inventory is performed for the whole system. The objective functions consist in minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and maximizing the financial value of the IFBR over a long-term planning horizon, while optimizing the existing P&P activity. Different economic and environmental indicators are introduced to compare Pareto optimal investment roadmaps. The proposed model leads to a decision support tool for the transformation of P&P companies by planning sustainable bioenergy investment implementation. Furthermore, this model may assist decision makers in emissions planning and reporting according to related regulations requirements. The obtained results show that the IFBR allows the P&P industry to diversify its portfolio and generate new revenues, while contributing substantially to emission reduction efforts in Canada and producing clean and renewable energy. However, government support will be needed to perform a successful business plan. To provide a road map for sustainable investment in bioenergy, a multi-objective mixed integer model has been developed. The obtained results show that the redesign of the business plan integrating investment in bioenergy production according to the sustainability paradigms has become possible using a systemic and decision support tool. The IFBR allows the pulp and paper industry to diversify its portfolio and generate new revenues while contributing substantially to emission reduction efforts in Canada and producing clean and renewable energy. The robustness analysis of the model, in the case of incubator activity market difficulty, proves that the investment technology architecture preserves the integrity of the IFBR, particularly in terms of energy self-sufficiency.

Furthermore, the model provides the basis for implementing a dedicated environmental-economic accounting. Thus, the management of the environmental component enriches the information system allowing the calculation of the carbon stock, the transfer of the carbon attribute to resellers and the compliance with the environmental reporting requirements. In addition, the model allows the manipulation of the allowances and the trade related, while measuring progress towards sustainable development goals.

Finally, it should be pointed out that ethanol pathway implementation needs economic incentives to reinforce its viability. It is proved that market incentives improve the overall sustainability performance of the biorefinery. In particular, government support will be needed to perform a successful business plan when integrating ethanol pathway.

We are currently investigating the use of scenario trees and multi-stage stochastic programming to take into account more uncertainties in the proposed mathematical model. Other research perspectives include the integration of social dimensions taking into account the social acceptability of large-scale biorefinery projects by the social community, based on potential impacts on regional development.

"Sustainability, TQM and Value Co-Creation Processes: The Role of Critical Success Factors","Sustainability views firm success and the welfare-wellbeing of societies in which they develop as closely inter-related. Value co-creation assumes that firms create value not only for themselves, but also for all actors willing to participate in co-creation processes, as well as for the whole ecosystem in which they operate. Thus, co-creation can sustain social development and sustainability. However, to ensure sustainability through value co-creation processes, TQM principles must be followed and Critical Success Factors (CSFs) reinterpreted following this perspective. In this important, but understudied context, the aim of the paper is to focus on value co-creation processes fostering sustainability, identifying which CSFs are most suitable to best support each phase of these processes. The paper is based on a review of the literature and bridges sustainability, value co-creation, TQM, EM and IMS literature for the first time, proposing a new model of value co-creation processes, which considers it a never ending cycle. The proposed model presents and discusses, for the first time, the most important CSFs to foster sustainability and opens the discussion on how to re-interpret quality principles, which must also be followed in value co-creation processes. The paper makes some important contributions. It: (1) bridges the sustainability, value co-creation, TQM, EM and IMS literature for the first time; (2) proposes a new model of value co-creation processes, considering this as a never ending cycle; (3) creates the first value co-creation model that encompasses the most important CSFs to foster sustainability through quality processes; (4) opens the discussion and leads the way to the re-interpretation of quality principles in the value co-creation process literature.
From a theoretical point of view, linking the sustainability and value co-creation literature opens new avenues of research, but also sheds light on the new role firms can play, not only with their partners, but at a broader level, further underlining why economy and society cannot be separated, but need to be integrated even more successfully within the firm to foster sustainability on behalf of the entire society. Moreover, having considered the role of the identified CSFs and also considering the EM and IMS literature in value co-creation processes represent a first attempt at including TQM principles in value co-creation processes towards sustainability. Therefore, this paper contributes to the value co-creation approach following the strategic perspective in that the proposed model includes the quality principles as suggested by Ramaswamy and Ozcan [8]. It also contributes to the sustainability literature in that it opens new perspectives to understand how sustainability can relate to other managerial philosophies and can share with them the firm’s key drivers and activities. In this domain, Lozano et al [117] have recently suggested to focus future studies on corporate sustainability developing an integrative theory able to holistically include it in firm theories; this paper moves in this direction. Moreover, the literature review on CSFs performed in this study highlighted the common traits among different managerial approaches, the analysis of which has not yet been completely performed and which can also represent a future step of this research. On this point, it is worth remembering that a recent study invites us to focus on “Quality Management practices and tools [that] must be developed and adapted in order to support sustainability considerations” [118] (p. 1); this paper also welcomes this suggestion, contributing to the TQM literature, without forgetting about the strategic perspective proposed by the value co-creation approach.
From a managerial point of view, the paper could give guidance to firms in understanding how their TQM, EM and even IMS implementation knowledge and experience helps create and run effective value co-creation processes towards sustainability and can also suggest how to reinterpret CSFs through operationalization using the value co-creation lens. In fact, the paper initiates the creation of a sole framework for firm activities, which encompasses quality, value co-creation and sustainability that are closely linked to each other and should be achieved together. Being aware of the common key drivers and activities that could be run simultaneously to achieve value co-creation and sustainability would also help managers in realizing cost saving and make more effective their management of integrated systems towards a better performance under different profiles.
This paper, having made an initial attempt to bridge the sustainability, value co-creation and TQM, EM and IMS literature and to identify important CSFs in realizing value co-creation processes able to foster sustainability, also has some limitations: above all, the discussion of CSFs is not exhaustive in that only some CSFs have been considered. The background of the paper could also be enhanced performing an extensive literature review, using other methodologies and/or databases and/or search engines and/or other keywords. Moreover, the model is the first one proposed at the intersection of sustainability, value co-creation following a strategic perspective and CSFs, and therefore, future research should encompass other issues not fully considered in this first attempt to bridge these streams of literature. Indeed, this research paper only encompasses a theoretical approach, which should be tested through an empirical study. This could certainly be a future avenue of research, even if perhaps a more in-depth discussion of the identified CSFs should be put in place, also considering DART insights. Moreover, after having reinterpreted the CSFs, it would be well worth seeking to better understand how they relate to each other, using the value co-creation approach lens. When performing the empirical studies already envisaged, it would be also worth considering new and relevant CSFs in this domain and also to try to measure their importance in the effective implementation of the model proposed.",Sustainability,,
Technology roadmaps: An evaluation of their success in the renewable energy sector,"Strategy literature has highlighted success factors for technology roadmaps. However, as roadmaps have evolved – from traditional, single organisation roadmaps, towards multiple organisation, sector level roadmaps – their objectives and success criteria have also changed. This paper develops a set of roadmap evaluation metrics, firmly focussed on evaluating the level of success of a roadmap based on whether its objectives have been translated into actions or policies by the target organisation, and uses them to analyse four renewable energy roadmaps to determine the success factors for developing a contemporary multi-organisation roadmap. The analysis revealed a number of success factors distinctly different from those for traditional roadmaps. The study concludes that, alongside the traditional technology roadmaps, a new type of roadmap has emerged, whose principal aim is political persuasion. These roadmaps are written by multiple organisations, often at the sector level, to persuade governments that they should implement the actions and recommendations set out. As a result of the emergence of this new type of roadmap, new metrics and guidance are required for roadmap construction compared to traditional roadmaps. This study corroborates and significantly adds to previous work which has identified the evolution of technology roadmaps from traditional organisational technology roadmaps (whilst acknowledging that traditional, single organisation technology roadmaps are still a widely used and effective strategic planning tool).

The analysis revealed that, whilst traditional roadmapping processes and success factors are still relevant, roadmaps have evolved and a new type of multi-organisation roadmap has emerged which is much more dynamic with more information imbedded in it. The underlying reasons why the success factors are different from traditional success factors are based upon the difference in assumed level of commitment to implementing the roadmap. For a traditional, single organisation roadmap, if there is commitment to developing the roadmap from all stakeholders, including the main decision makers, it is reasonable to assume that there is a high level of commitment to implementing the roadmap's actions and recommendations. However, this assumption does not hold for many contemporary multi-organisation roadmaps due to the fact that (as illustrated by the four roadmaps analysed) the intended target audience of the roadmap and its recommendations are a separate entity than the collective authorship.

This is reinforced by a recent IEA document containing guidance for developing and implementing energy technology roadmaps [40], which is largely in line with both the traditional success criteria described in the academic literature, and with the success factors developed here. The report states that “even if a roadmap is well designed and has clear goals and committed participants, it still needs an audience committed to implementing it. Senior industry executives and/or policy officials must be engaged in the process, as they can authorise resources for the roadmap's completion and commit to implementing its findings.”

This fact, that the intended target audience of the roadmap and its recommendations are a separate entity than the collective authorship, requires roadmaps to take on a more persuasive nature, based on the fact that they have to convince the intended target audience that the roadmap presents the best way forward for the sector in question and that they – as the responsible decision makers – should implement the actions and recommendations set out.

In general, for traditional technology roadmaps, it is possible to ensure a high level of commitment to implementing the roadmap's actions and recommendations by taking care that the method utilised to develop the roadmap is robust and inclusive, ensuring the buy-in of all the necessary stakeholders — including the main decision makers. Acknowledging that, in some cases, aspects of in-company politics may exist which make a persuasive element to a traditional technology roadmaps necessary and mean that it is not possible to assume a high level of commitment to the roadmap, this is in clear contrast to multi-organisation technology roadmaps where a defining feature, as revealed in the analysis, of many roadmaps is the fact that the intended target audience of the roadmap and its recommendations are a distinctly separate entity than the collective authorship. This is a key area of differentiation between traditional technology roadmaps and multi-organisation technology roadmaps.

It is clear that there is a recurring theme in the four roadmaps analysed in this study (and in a large number of contemporary multi-organisation roadmaps): the intended target audience for the roadmaps and their recommendations are government and political actors. Whether aimed at the UK or Scottish governments specifically, or more widely at European and international governments, this is the case for all four of the roadmaps analysed.

This is in alignment with the work conducted by Cahill and Scapolo [41] and Da Costa et al. [8], which has identified that since the mid-1990s, various actors have adapted the technology roadmaps methodology to provide the strategic intelligence needed by policy makers to optimise their decisions and investments in areas where science and technology play a prominent role.

Building on this work, this study has found that the evolution of the technology roadmaps process has led to the development of a new type of technology roadmaps: roadmaps whose principal purpose is political persuasion. This is a significant finding which builds upon the work identified above and which highlights the use of technology roadmaps to provide intelligence for policy makers in areas where science and technology play a prominent role. Over and above providing the information to policy makers, necessary to optimise their decisions, roadmaps for political persuasion are focussed on influencing and persuading the policy maker to implement the recommendations set out.

technology roadmaps have evolved from a purely strategic role (used by individual companies to guide their decisions and investments), to a persuasive and influencing role (roadmaps written primarily to persuade political actors that they present the best way forward). technology roadmaps for political persuasion are commonly written by a collaboration of multiple organisations, often at a sectoral level, and aim to persuade and influence governments to implement the actions and recommendations set out.

The concept of technology roadmaps for political persuasion adds to the work of Da Costa et al. [7] who developed the idea that technology roadmaps for policy intelligence could assist policy makers under information overload and time pressure to grasp effectively the most important elements and relations within complex systems.

There are 3 important characteristics of technology roadmaps for political persuasion, each of which is clearly different to those for traditional technology roadmaps:
1.
The author of the technology roadmaps is usually multiple organisations who have come together to develop the roadmap with a common objective.

2.
The intended audience of the technology roadmaps is a separate entity than the collective author. The intended audience is often government, and is also often composed of multiple organisations/departments.

3.
The purpose of the technology roadmaps is to persuade the target audience that the roadmap presents the best way forward and they should implement the actions and recommendations set out.


Traditional success factors for the author of a roadmap, the target audience, and the ongoing review/update of the roadmap have to be refined to suit this new, evolved type of roadmap for political persuasion. The role of government in technology roadmaps is also very different for technology roadmaps for political persuasion than it is for traditional technology roadmaps, and this is clear from the analysis in this study. However, it is important to highlight that the important role of governments as the target audience of many modern day roadmaps, and the finding that – as the key target audience – governments should be directly involved in a roadmap's production, is in direct conflict with De Laat and McKibbin [10]. De Laat and McKibbin [10] stated that “…government has no major role in these [technology roadmaps] exercises, ultimately borne by the industry. It is the willingness of firms to cooperate, and even to initiate technology roadmaps, that is a major success criterion for technology roadmaps.” This statement is refuted by the undertaking of a technology roadmaps for Canada's civil infrastructure systems in 2002 [42], and by the MEG marine energy roadmap [26] which both saw governments play an active role in the development of the roadmap and an active role in implementing the recommendations. Overall the paper by De Laat and McKibbin [10] is limited in its view of the role that government has to play in developing a technology roadmaps.

Every industry has its own unique barriers to be overcome, and as a result, roadmap authors need to tailor the roadmapping process to address issues specific to their industry. If this advice is heeded, the analysis conducted has yielded some important results that can be used by new authors looking to develop roadmaps for political persuasion in any sector.

The application of renewable energy to social housing: A systematic review,"Low-income housing associations provide a unique opportunity for renewable energy installations, through potential scale of implementation sites, and in reducing social and financial costs to tenants. As an emerging field, a systematic review format was chosen as a method of providing a ‘state-of-the-art’ analysis for practitioners and researchers in the field of renewable energy and social housing applications. While literature reviews are common in analysis of energy applications across many fields, systematic reviews are much rarer. Because research/policy interest in the application of renewable energy technologies and social Šhousing appears to be growing, this review aims to bring together the disparate literature already available. This review set out to determine what are the common 1. Success Factors, 2. Barriers and 3. Motivations, evident in previous research surrounding the application of renewable energy technologies in social housing contexts? Common findings from 67 research cases were synthesised under 3 a priori themes of Motivations, Barriers and Success Factors. Many articles revolved around the user interface and potential barriers to integration of technology, particularly where user engagement is not carried out sufficiently. It is suggested that this emphasis reflects a broader trend in applying socio-technical approaches in the field of energy research. Through this systematic review it was found that much of the previous work surrounding the application of renewable energy and social housing remained within the domain of case-specific studies that provided recommendations based on technocratic or engineering-based methodologies. By extracting data from the 67 articles within this review, it was found that many of the important motivational, success and hindering factors related to the unique relationship between tenant and housing that social housing arrangements produce. This previous focus in the literature on technological case-based articles rather than those that incorporate broader socio-technical applications, is most likely due to the relative novelty of the field, corresponding to an only recent shift in the availability and range of renewable energy technologies available and scalable to social housing contexts. More recent articles have increasingly highlighted the importance of the aspects of tenant acceptance and education, and this is reflective of an overall trend in energy studies to incorporate broader socio-technical perspectives (Sovacool, 2014).

While literature reviews within the field of energy studies are common, the use of a systematic review protocol in extracting and compiling information is quite rare, particularly when also including narrative review component. It is possible that this lack of attention paid to systematic reviews is also reflective of the historically case-based technological (and often quantitative) emphasis of energy studies, and it is suggested that as the field does move to increasingly incorporate broader socio-technical perspectives, systematic reviews may become more pertinent and useful. It is suggested that the systematic review methodology provides a structured protocol within which to approach a comprehensive literature review on a given topic, however it is still susceptible to human errors in judgement, particularly around inclusion criteria, and for this reason the peer-review process is integral.

The application of renewable energy to social housing creates opportunities for potentially streamlined and widespread strategic renewable energy interventions, but this also poses unique barriers and complications as it is generally not driven specifically from the bottom-up. The literature was overwhelmingly dominated by the importance of understanding residents, engaging them appropriately and maintaining that engagement.

This review set out to determine what are the common 1. Success Factors, 2. Barriers and 3. Motivations, evident in previous research surrounding the application of renewable energy technologies in social housing contexts? With regards to success factors (1), it was found that perceived benefits by tenants are important, both in the adoption and acceptance of the technology, but also in the ongoing maintenance and efficient operation of the technology. However, in many cases a major barrier (2) to implementation was the over-complication of information provided to tenants. With regards to motivational factors (3), despite environmental considerations playing a strong role in providing incentives for the application of Renewable Energy, unsurprisingly, due to the low income nature of social housing developments, a large motivational factor for the implementation remained the perceived financial incentives and security that such decentralised generation can yield. In practice however, evidence of the financial viability of renewable energy applications varied widely due to factors ranging from geographic location (and respective policy platforms and incentives in place), culture of energy use and capacity for adaptation.",Energy Policy,,The application of renewable energy to social housing- A systematic review.pdf
The impact of behavioural factors in the renewable energy investment decision making process: Conceptual framework and empirical findings,"  Investments in renewable energy (Renewable Energy) technologies are regarded with increasing interest as an effective means to stimulate growth and accelerate the recovery from the recent financial crisis. Yet, despite their appeal, and the numerous policies implemented to promote these technologies, the diffusion of Renewable Energy projects remains somehow below expectations. This limited penetration is also due to a lack of appropriate financing and to a certain reluctance to invest in these technologies. In order to shed light on this phenomenon, in this paper we examine the decision making process underlying investments in Renewable Energy technologies. We propose and test a conceptual model that examines the structural and behavioural factors affecting the investors decisions as well as the relationship between Renewable Energy investments and portfolio performance. Applying econometric techniques on primary data collected from a sample of European investors, we study how the investors’ a-priori beliefs, their preferences over policy instruments and their attitude toward technological risk affect the likelihood of investing in Renewable Energy projects. We also demonstrate that portfolio performance increases with an increase of the Renewable Energy share in the portfolio. Implications for scholars, investors, technology managers and policy makers are derived and discussed.
Renewable energy sources have the potential to play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel consumption in all sectors of the economy. However, huge additional investments are needed to realize this potential: the draft Copenhagen Climate Treaty issued by several NGOs calls for a doubling of market investments by 2012 and quadrupling by 2020 to attain the proposed carbon emission reduction targets (Meyer et al., 2009). Needless to say, this is particularly challenging in a context of global economic slowdown such as the one the world is currently experiencing. Although investors can play a key role in mobilizing capital to support renewable energy technologies, evidence suggests that they are often reluctant to do so. Clearly, dedicated policies can, and have been implemented to stimulate renewable energy investments. However, many of the efforts conducted so far have been only moderately effective because, by failing to understand the behavioural context in which investors make decisions, they were unable to leverage some of the true drivers of the investment decision process.

In a market economy, the effectiveness of policies aimed at mobilizing renewable energy investments is critically dependent upon their impact on investors’ behaviours. To maximize the impact of future policies, policy makers need to get a better understanding of how investors behave, and of how they take their decisions, particularly in regards to the key psychological factors that may influence their behaviors and actions.

Yet, despite this evidence, there is a surprising lack of rigorous empirical studies examining these issues in the energy policy literature. This paper represents one of the first attempts to fill in this gap. Drawing upon studies in behavioural finance, we have put forth a theoretical model that examines how investors a-priori beliefs, their preferences over policy instruments and their attitude toward technological risk affect the decision to invest in renewable energy projects and, in turn, the performance of the investments.

Our analysis has brought some interesting findings to light. In particular, it has revealed that a priori beliefs on the technical effectiveness of the investment opportunities play a much more important role than market beliefs in driving investments, implicitly suggesting that agents consider the proven reliability of a technology as a necessary condition for investing in it, whilst they believe that market inefficiencies can be corrected through the adoption of appropriate policy instruments. The results have also revealed a group of investors with extremely short investment horizons, who have a strong preference for short term policies that provide high levels of financial incentives for a limited amount of time over long term policies that guarantee a moderate but stable support for a longer time.

The paper makes a contribution to the energy policy, strategic management and behavioural finance literatures, and has some important implications for managerial practice. Firstly, the incorporation of cognitive and behavioural elements into the analysis of policy effectiveness is an important theoretical contribution and produces a more accurate description of the relationship between policies and investment. By providing a better understanding of investors’ behaviours, the research will help policy makers design more effective policy instruments to support the market deployment of sustainable energy technologies.

The study also contributes to the theory of social acceptance of renewable energy innovation. As observed by Wüstenhagen et al. (2007), while factors influencing socio-political and community acceptance are increasingly recognized as being important in the understanding of policy effectiveness, market acceptance has received less attention so far. By investigating investors’ acceptance of climate and energy policies, the present research contributes to fill in this gap.

Finally, our results appear also relevant for practitioners in the sustainable energy market. A priory beliefs and cognitive biases create additional risk elements that restrain the likelihood of raising capital for clean energy investments. The analysis of these elements as opposed to more rational risk factors can help investors get a more balanced view of policy risks and opportunities in this promising business sector.

Like most research, our study is not exempt from limitations. First, the results may be difficult to generalize because the study was restricted to a specific empirical context and the sample is skewed toward venture capitalists and private equity funds. Second, the variables used in the model to measure portfolio performance are self assessed and measured by means of a three-point likert scale. This choice was dictated by the results of the pre-test, which revealed that investors were reluctant to disclose any performance-related information beyond a mere first order assessment of their ranking with respect to peers (below, in line with, above). Although we have controlled the presence of CMV and re-estimated the performance equation through a multinomial logit model, the use of objective, quantitative measures of performance would have been ideal and remains necessary to further validate our findings. Third, although we did control for some exogenous factors, the relatively limited sample size did not allow for a better differentiation among renewable energy investments. The survey included investments in a wide range of different renewable energy technologies with different degrees of innovativeness and risk. Clearly, some of the phenomena observed may be technology-dependent and require further investigation. Finally, we could not exclude a priori the presence of a reverse causal relationship between investment performance and the share of renewables in the investment portfolio. Over time, we would expect that rational investors who obtained above-average returns by adding renewables to their portfolios, will also tend to increase the share of Renewable Energy in their portfolios in the next investment round. Fully disentangling this reverse causality would require the availability of longitudinal data, which, unfortunately, were not available for this study. We expect to address some of these issues in follow-up works.",Energy Policy,,
"The institutional space of community initiatives for renewable energy: a comparative case study of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark","
Community initiatives for renewable energy are emerging across Europe but with varying numbers, success rates and strategies. A literature overview identifies structural, strategic and biophysical conditions for community success. Our analysis focuses on institutional structure, as we describe the variety between the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, and place this within the institutional context of the policies, power structures and energy discourses of each country.
We conducted a policy arrangements analysis with a series of semi-structured interviews, extensive content analysis of policy documents, media analysis and use of existing research, in a qualitative comparative analysis between the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark.
We demonstrate that the (evolving) institutional configuration of the energy sector strongly influences the available space for community initiative development. Denmark has a traditionally civil society-friendly energy sector, although opportunities for communities have decreased following the scaling up of production facilities. The Netherlands knows a predominantly market-oriented institutional arrangement that leaves little space for communities, but the potential for community based energy is increasingly recognized. In Germany, the typically state-dominant Energiewende strategy creates a window of opportunity for community initiatives that fit within the state policy.
We conclude that the institutional arrangement of the energy policy subsystem can both constrain or enable community energy projects. Decentralization appears to be one of the most important characteristics of the general institutional development and generally increases the institutional space for local (community) players. The alignment of discourses across government levels and actors is one of the important enabling features of an energy system, as it provides the stability and predictability of the system that enables communities to engage in renewable energy projects.
Community initiatives for renewable energy are emerging across Europe but with varying numbers, success rates and strategies. A literature overview identifies structural, strategic and biophysical conditions for community success. Our analysis focuses on institutional structure, as we describe the variety between the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, and place this within the institutional context of the policies, power structures and energy discourses of each country.

Community initiatives emerge across different (Western European) institutional contexts, but the characteristics of the institutional system influence their development, abundance and success. Next to differences in financial incentives, the relative positions of the state, market parties and communities and their goals and priorities are among the key factors that explain the rise and continuity of community initiatives. Below, we summarize our findings on how the institutional arrangements enable or constrain community initiatives, following the dimensions of the PAA.

Institutional space for community initiatives
Across the three countries, there are noticeable differences in the dominant policy discourse. In the Netherlands, this is a strongly economic rationale, which creates a misfit with the rising number of community initiatives that are mostly operating on the basis of environmental concerns. In Germany, the policy discourse is predominantly environmental, and the local communities act on this same rationale. This discursive coherence creates institutional support for communities. In Denmark, we see that the national government currently has a mixed environmental, social and economic discourse and that these (but primarily the economic) are recurring across government levels as well as within the local initiatives, which increases the cooperation between government and initiatives. This demonstrates the importance of the dimension of policy discourses, not only that it reflects environmental, economic or mixed rationales but also that national discourses can align with discourses of decentralized policy levels and of local communities. This alignment creates institutional (discursive) space for community initiatives. In terms of actors and resources, we see that the market parties pro-fossil fuels and pro-nuclear power have a strong presence in the Netherlands and Germany but are less dominant or even absent in Denmark. On the contrary, over the years, Denmark developed a strong role of large market parties for RE supply and turbine manufacturing. The government is most dominant in the German system and least in the Dutch, which demonstrates that some governmental steering, especially through financial incentives, is critical for community initiatives. In Denmark, decentralization is an important feature of institutional arrangement; the Kommuner acquire relatively not only more power but also large responsibilities. There are quite some differences between these Kommuner in their ambition, goals and activities for renewable energy, but most are ambitious and set up a large range of local projects. The resources for community initiatives are best accessible in Denmark, where FITs are guaranteed and subsidies for planning are available. Germany also has FITs and a number of local and regional subsidies. In the Netherlands, the subsidy scheme is the least elaborate and consistent. We see that the most enabling environment for community initiatives is an arrangement in which policies on the resource division are consistent and where powerful actors, whether governmental or market parties, have a stake in renewable energy.

Classification into the governance ideal types provided insight in the position of communities within the subsystem. Table 2 shows the key characteristics of each system in terms of the PAA, and which ideal-typical institutional arrangement this resembles most. We hypothesized that the Netherlands would have a market-oriented arrangement, that Germany would be strongly state-oriented and that in Denmark, communities would have a more dominant position. For the Danish case, this hypothesis has been falsified. Over the last decade, the economic rationale (including the economics of scale) has gained influence and has decreased the power of the communities in favour of state-initiated projects with large market parties. In the Netherlands and Denmark, the ideal types can indeed be recognized. The Netherlands can be categorized as a mostly economic or market-oriented policy arrangement. Policies are very often framed in terms of cost-benefit analyses, emphasizing risk avoidance rather than innovation and focusing on the (international) economic position of the country in energy supply and trade. German energy policy is much more state-based and proactive and, besides the emphasis (and possibility) of long-term industrial politics, is also more based on ethical issues regarding the environment, climate change and anti-nuclear considerations.

This is not to say that the Danes have abandoned their decentralized sustainability politics. The Danish state shows continuous ambition in RE policies, leading to the 100%-by-2050 target, and an ever more unambiguous steering role for the state as the market approach was deemed ‘insufficient’ to reach ambitious goals on its own. The Danish system is, though decentralized and having a strong role for the local authorities (Kommunerrer), also a state-oriented institutional system, with intensive cooperation between societal initiatives and governmental actors. The Danish state used to create much room for community initiatives, and one of the spin offs of its pro-RE policy is the establishment of strong RE market parties, which increase their prominence in the policy arrangement.

Community initiatives
The position, shape and approach of community initiatives vary considerably across the countries. A number of differences that stand out are listed below.

In Table 3, we see different dynamics between the countries, which can be explained by the differences in the institutional systems of each country. However, the trend across the systems is that community initiatives are rising and becoming more powerful. Even though the ownership model in Denmark is changing for wind turbines, community initiatives are not disappearing from the scene. Community initiatives are gaining influence in Germany and the Netherlands, and whether the shift to RE is approached from an economic or an environmental perspective, and taken slow or fast, communities seem to be a key ingredient in the new RE mix. In the ‘Methods’ section, it was stressed that the ideal type of a community-oriented arrangement does not stand on its own (though ideal types never do) but needs to be supported by the state and market. In none of the case study countries, the community orientation is dominant, but in Germany and Denmark, a combination seems to be possible of both of top-down implementation of ambitious environmental targets and local facilitation and innovation, thus creating more institutional space for community initiatives. This increases the fertile ground for communities to (co-)develop projects and thus steers the energy sector towards a more heterogeneous mix of initiatives at the local level.
The policy arrangements in the three countries vary considerably, which can be reconstructed by looking at the conditions external to the policy subsystem and a series of policy responses to these conditions. Examples are the economic crisis that forced Denmark to focus on renewable energy but also on the economic most viable options (large scale investments), the biophysical conditions in the Netherlands that explain a focus on fossil fuels and the anti-nuclear sentiments in combination with the shock of the 2011 Fukushima disaster that sped up the phasing out of nuclear power in Germany. This interplay between external conditions, policy and political decisions and dynamics between the actors in the policy subsystem are indirectly - by way of changing arrangements - determining the institutional space for communities.

Our findings suggest that, for the institutional space for community initiatives, the precise content of the dominant discourse seems less determining than the alignment of a dominant discourse across government levels and actors. If the community has a rationale similar to the government, this creates opportunities for community initiatives. Moreover, the division of resources and the rules of the game determine the availability of funding, permits, etc., but their precise content seems less important than their stability and predictability and how they are in line with the needs of the communities.

However, these conclusions do not imply that structural characteristics are more important for success than agency or biophysical characteristics. Although international variation can be explained through different national institutional arrangements, all interviews pointed out that for individual projects, agency characteristics such as leadership skills, pro-environmental attitudes and management skills play a vital role. Moreover, the possibilities and planning processes for projects depend on the (bio)physical conditions, such as the degree of urbanization. In the past, most projects were realized in rural regions, but the increasing variety of projects has led to more project designs appropriate for built environments, and projects became more equally distributed between cities and rural areas. Although this is the case for small projects, national governments still tend to focus on large rural and offshore projects.

This research has sketched three national arrangements and the position of the community movement therein. This broad scope gives an overview of national dynamics and trends, but more detailed studies of cases of sustainable regions, cities and initiatives could provide more insight in the dynamics between the involved actors and policies. This could strengthen and nuance the analysis of this article. Moreover, there remains a need for a comprehensive overview of community initiatives. The lack of reliable data on the number and activities of community initiatives poses a constraint for this analysis, and further research will increase the validity of the findings and provide more insight into a category of actors that is diverse, rapidly growing and increasingly important for RE provision.

The International Renewable Energy Agency: a success story in institutional innovation?,"This article interprets the role and signicance of the International Renewable Energy Agency (International renwable energy Agency) in global environmental and energy governance. First, we conduct a comparative analysis of International renwable energy Agency and other recent innovations in global governance, showing that International renwable energy Agency stands out with regard to the timing of creation, speed of ratication, and focus of the mandate. Second, we identify three mechanisms through which International renwable energy Agency can promote the global diffusion of renewable energy: (1) by offering valuable epistemic services to its member states, (2) by serving as a focal point for renewable energy in a scattered global institutional environment, and (3) by mobilizing other international institutions to promote renewable energy. Finally, we reect on the conditions that could make International renwable energy Agencys policies a continued success and on the lessons that the experience with International renwable energy Agency holds for other attempts at innovation in global governance. This article has described and evaluated the role of International renwable energy Agency in the global energy landscape. The central thrust of our argument is that International renwable energy Agency presents an unusually innovative approach to promoting renewable energy. By focusing on a narrowly dened set of goals related to the deployment of renewables, International renwable energy Agency has, in spite of a small budget and the lack of a proven track record, established itself as a major provider of epistemic services to the least developed countries. International renwable energy Agencys mandate, which focuses on renewable energy, allows it to sidestep some of the political controversies that surround nuclear energy and climate change. The budding organizations success depends, we have proposed, to a large extent on its ability to maintain this sharp focus. It is neither politically wise nor cost-effective for International renwable energy Agency to become tangled in issues that are only tangentially relevant to removing obstacles to renewable energy deployment, such as climate negotiations. More generally, International renwable energy Agencys deliberate lack of emphasis on collective action and politically controversial aspects of renewable energy could suggest a promising strategy for other international organizations that deal with environmental problems. Based on International renwable energy Agencys rst years, the promise and pitfalls of this strategy warrant further research. For example, are the benets of steering clear of collective action enough to outweigh the danger that international organizations lose their current, if admittedly weak, ability to regulate state behavior?

We have also argued that International renwable energy Agencys success could offer useful lessons for other initiatives in global governance. Although International renwable energy Agencys success may seem almost obvious with the benet of hindsight, sustainable political activism and careful institutional design were necessary for the organization to have a promising start, and it remains to be seen if International renwable energy Agency can maintain its momentum in the long run. Perhaps most importantly, the case of International renwable energy Agency emphasizes the importance of creating participation incentives for countries. As a global center for renewable energy information, International renwable energy Agency lled an important gap in the governance architecture. The least developed countries ocked to International renwable energy Agency because they expected handsome benets from policy advice and related information, such as resource assessments and capacity building. At the same time, industrialized and emerging economies have joined International renwable energy Agency because they have incentives to participate in the process that shapes the global policy landscape for renewable energy.

We have yet to comment on the potentially more dramatic effects of International renwable energy Agency on the global governance of energy and the environment. Over the medium to long term, International renwable energy Agency could also gradually build up a constituency of support for the global spread of renewables. While International renwable energy Agency primarily serves as a collector and transmitter of information, it has also a clear mission to promote the development and deployment of renewable energy worldwide. More than an information clearinghouse, International renwable energy Agency could convey a clear pro-renewables message to a wider audience.

We know from earlier research that international institutions can increase the electoral leverage and informational status of constituencies in favor of the policies conducted by the international institution in question (Dai 2005; Baccini and Urpelainen 2012). In doing

so, international institutions can facilitate a decentralized constituency system, whereby the goals and mission of the international institution are upheld by states, not because they are cajoled by other states to comply with their international engagements, but because domestic constituencies pressure their government to behave in the way that the international institution prescribes.

Although it is too early to say if International renwable energy Agency has enough legitimacy and credibility to achieve this goal, the possibility certainly cannot be rejected out of hand. Indeed, the argument has already been suggested with regard to International renwable energy Agency. As Meyer (2012, 343) observes, International renwable energy Agencys focus on reducing transaction costs for investment can mobilize private nancial resources that, once invested in the success of renewable energy, provide a political constituency in favor of renewable support. In other words, International renwable energy Agency can help to create or empower domestic and transnational lobbies in favor of renewable energy. In theory, this could instigate a self-reinforcing dynamic, whereby leadership at home could lead to leadership abroad. Although International renwable energy Agencys current direction is already promising, leadership in mobilizing the renewable energy community across the world would raise the importance of the organization to an altogether new level.

The keys to renewable energy success in the Middle East,"The Middle East is ramping up efforts to diversify its energy portfolios. The flagship Shams 1 solar project in Abu Dhabi has recently completed and Saudi Arabia has released an important white paper on renewable energy. But several issues in the white paper are in need of clarification and development of renewable power in Saudi will likely involve further hurdles. Fair and reasonable feed-in tariffs remain a priority to facilitate implementation of renewable programmes throughout the GCC. With the recently-announced completion of the 100 megawatt Shams 1 solar project in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia's publication of a white paper on renewables, the Middle East seems to be on the verge of an energy revolution. The lack of fair and reasonable feed-in tariffs to allow competition with heavily subsidised thermal power generation is a key reason why implementation of renewable energy programmes has been slow in the Gulf.

""For renewable energy to work, we need to see a reassessment of the price the population in these regions is prepared to pay for power,"" said Elder. ""The only way to get a feed-in tariff that works is if the wider energy sector falls in behind it.""

The recently-completed Shams 1 project addressed this dilemma. To get around the solar project's higher tariffs, the government paid a significant portion of the tariff itself.

The rest of the charge was passed through to the end consumer. This created a bifurcation of the tariff charge, known as the green payment agreement.

""Shams has effectively pushed back the need for a legal and regulatory environment for renewable projects in the UAE because the government directly paid a substantial part of the tariff in lieu of a feed in tariff or equivalent incentive,"" said Saul Daniel, an Abu Dhabi-based partner with White & Case.

""But in relation to other markets in the region, setting up the legal and regulatory framework to allow renewable projects to compete is what's needed now,"" he added.",International Financial Law Review,,
The outlook for renewable energy in Navarre: An economic profile,"This paper describes the outlook and development of renewable energy in Navarre (Spain), which has become one of the leading regions in renewables over the last 10 years. This paper focuses its attention on the key features of the energy policy in Navarre, where there has emerged a dynamic enterprise sector. This sector has enormously increased its employment rates in the region. The success of renewable energy in Navarre is the result of the joint impact of decisive institutional support, industrial initiatives and consensus among social agents with regard to renewables. Tax incentives and local investment programs designed to break down the reluctance of local authorities and a campaign to obtain public support have, moreover, proven more efficient than the prior feed-in tariffs scheme, designed to develop the renewable energy sector and create international companies within it. The paper culminates in a detailed prognosis based on the SRN2003 survey of employment and installed power, which covers the majority of the firms operating in the Navarre renewables sector. Findings, however, suggest that the future of the sector in Navarre could be held back by the shortage of trained workers. This article might serve as a pertinent example for the deployment of renewables at regional level worldwide. The advantages of renewable energy over traditional energy sources, such as fossil fuels, are well known and evident. The European Union has therefore promoted renewable energy in Europe, setting the following goal for 2010: 22% of electrical consumption and 12% of primary energy consumption should be supplied by renewables. Interest in and concern for renewable energy has increased in most European countries.

Furthermore, manufacturing opportunities at local level have provided a strong motivation for regional governments to promote the production and use of renewable energies. New manufacturing is being effective in reviving sluggish local economies through the creation of direct and indirect jobs.

Navarre was one of the first Spanish regions to invest in renewable energy; the wind industry being its primary focus. Hence, the main objective in the drive to reduce the energy shortage in Navarre is being met, since lack of energy sources and foreign dependency are less patent nowadays. With the introduction of tax incentives to drive the growth of wind power—provided that the equipment was produced locally—manufacturing took off and, within the space of a few years, the region was generating almost 50% of its energy needs from wind sources. According to present targets, Navarre's wind capacity should reach 1334 MW by 2006, making it self-sufficient in electricity consumption from renewable energy.

Among the positive aspects of the renewable energy support policies in Navarre, we might mention the following:
(1)
The success of renewable energy in Navarre is the result of the joint impact of decisive institutional support and consensus among social agents with regard to renewables. Similarly, the implementation of policies to reduce local reluctance and the introduction of tax incentives for investors have proven more efficient than the feed-in tariffs scheme for helping to create international companies in this sector.

(2)
The growth and success of renewable energy in Europe are based on each country specialising in one specific type of energy. Thus, Navarre is no exception. Wind energy is the paradigm of Navarre's success in the field of renewables.

(3)
Navarre has built around renewables a dynamic enterprise sector, with high technological standards. This sector is focused on the production, utilisation and maintenance of capital goods in order to generate energy. Expectations for these companies are tremendous.

(4)
Renewables have had a positive influence on employment in Navarre. This has helped greatly in achieving balance in the spread of jobs across different areas of Navarre, a fact that is confirmed by national and international studies.

(5)
Last but not least, the estimations of employment data in the renewable energy sector, which were based on surveys in the enterprise sector, are more precise than if they had been based on physical magnitudes or registered activities data. We are led to this conclusion by the results of the RN2002 and the way they compare with those of the TERES II project or the IREEG report.


There are, however, other less positive aspects to the renewable energy support policies that may limit the future success of the renewable energy policies:
(1)
The main limitation standing in the way of the progress in renewable energy in Navarrese companies is the shortage of qualified workers, particularly graduates specialised in renewables. Future policies should therefore include measures to adapt and increase the training of future workers to meet the new needs of firms.

(2)
Future renewable policies will focus on certain kinds of renewable energies, to the detriment of the most fully developed renewable energy in Navarre, which is wind energy. This future situation could produce unnecessary uncertainty among firms in the renewables sector, and have dramatic effects on employment and investment. Moreover, all kinds of renewable energies do not meet with the same degree of public support, as revealed by the recent manifestations of public resistance to the installation of biofuel and biogas factories in the region.",Energy Policy,,
The success of multi-sector participation in the management of revenue for beneficiary communities of South African renewable energy companies – sub-model A,"Multi-sector participation is one of three sub-models that resulted from the splitting of the original model that resulted from the data analysis as part of a thesis entitled ‘A theoretical for successful management of revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa.’ The sub-model provides specific guidance for the multi-sector participation of enterprises, stakeholders, industry experts and community development practitioners in the renewable energy sector to create a pro-active, effective, and relevant decision-making process for achieving success in the management of revenue for beneficiary communities. To address the primary objective, a number of secondary objectives were formulated through the development of a conceptual model consisting of identified variables based on a comprehensive survey of the related literature. By constructing a path diagram between the independent variable and subsequent intervening and dependent variables, appropriate hypotheses were developed. Primary data sourced from an identified national and international population of community management practitioners were collected using an electronic measuring instrument. These data were analysed and tested empirically using structural equation modelling. The determinants that were identified through a review of the literature as elements of multi-sector participation that influences the success of revenue management for beneficiary communities for South African renewable energy companies included the use of outside advice, financial management, support services, and good governance. The independent variables associated with submodel of multi-sector participation, including distinctive benefits, support services, outside advice and financial management, and the intervening variable of good governance, allude to multi-sector participation in revenue management for beneficiary communities. ‘Multi-sector’ refers to the involvement of government, the private sector and civilsociety. ‘Participation’ refers to taking advantage of knowledge and skills, accessing expertise, forming partnerships and accessing resources. The spirit of ubuntu, expressed as ‘I am because of others’ must be deliberately and actively embraced and put into practice. It must be noted that financial management and good governance are important components of the sub-model and should be treated as such. The link between corporate social responsibility and revenue management as discussed confirms the importance of multi-sector participation. Multisector participants should include the following: local government – Integrated Development Plan; provincial government – Provincial Strategic Plan; national government – National Development Plan; • private sector – IPPs, service providers, consultants etc; • community-based organisations – NPOs, community forums etc; and  academic institutions – universities, technical colleges etc. The role of the intervening variable, good governance, must form an integral part of this submodel to ensure that multi-sector participation
includes and assists the beneficiary community at all times and in every situation. Good governanceprinciples can be included in activities such as: the appointment of industry experts and service
providers; the formation of multi-sector partnerships or collaborates; the management of finance and financial transactions; the monitoring, evaluation and reporting of all activities; and the inclusion of policies and procedures in all management processes. Co-ordinated multi-sector participation through providing support services, outside advice and financial management can contribute meaningfully towards successful development in beneficiarycommunities. Table 7 gives keys steps to consider for multi-stakeholder management. The study provided new insight into revenue management for beneficiary communities in the
RSA. With the renewable energy sector being one of the fastest growing sectors in the RSA, and the government being determined to link the location of renewable energy facilities to economic development, this research has given new insight into SED and ED revenue management and contributes to the body of knowledge concerning revenue management for beneficiary communities. A continuation to this article titled, ‘Sub-model B - The success of transformational change on the management of revenue for beneficiary communities of South African renewable energy companies”, will be written soon. This will be followed by the third and final article in the series titled ‘Sub-model C - The success of sustainable initiatives on the management of revenue for beneficiary communities of South African renewable energy companies’. A proposed
final article will conclude the study conducted by the author on ‘A theoretical model for successful management of revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa’.",J. energy South. Afr.,,
Toward Technology-Sensitive Catching-Up Policies: Insights from Renewable Energy in China,"The voluminous literature on industrial catching-up in Southeast Asian countries has regularly argued that successful catching-up largely depended on a committed state, which orchestrated industry development with a relatively uniform set of policies, including R&D support, subsidies, trade restrictions, and local content requirements. In contrast, recent contributions from the technology lifecycle literature have argued that policies should be tailored to differing technological characteristics in industries for mass-produced standardized goods, complex engineered products, and—as we argue—complex product systems (CoPS). In this paper, we extend this argument by introducing a set of separate policy mixes for each industry type, which appears most capable of providing the key resources required for catching-up: knowledge, market access, financial investment and technology legitimacy. This framework is used to analyze catching-up patterns in China’s wind, solar PV, and biomass power plant industries, drawing mainly on policy documents and 106 interviews with key industry actors.

We find that traditional top-down catching-up policies played a decisive role in the development of China’s wind industry, but were of limited importance in the early solar PV industry, and resulted only in a limited period of rapid growth in the biomass power plant industry. The relative progress achieved in these three industries is not related to top-down policy guidance alone, but also to private sector initiative, international interdependencies, and flexibility in adapting policy mixes to each industry’s technological characteristics. These results suggest that policy makers in newly industrializing countries (NICs) should avoid drafting generic sector plans, but should tailor plans to individual industries, and respond to changing policy support needs as technological capacities and global competitiveness develop. This paper aimed at developing a technology-sensitive perspective on catching-up policies and deriving a novel heuristic for analyzing supportive policy mixes for three generic industry types. Our framework and empirical illustration showed that this approach may lead to more fine-grained explanations on why catching-up trajectories succeed or fail and may help policy makers to better align their interventions to an emerging industry’s specific needs. Our results also revealed novel insights related to the Chinese state’s role in catching up in renewable energy technologies and in terms of policy lessons for other NICs that aim at supporting catching-up.

First, our results revealed that even in an authoritarian and centralist state like China, successful catching-up is not dependent on smart top-down government direction alone, but rather on policy maker’s openness for policy experimentation and adapting policy measures to an industry’s key technology characteristics. Conventional (import substitution-based) catching-up policies appeared most supportive for industries with design-intensive products, while manufacturing-intensive and CoPS industries necessitate policy strategies that more strongly embrace bottom up agency by industry stakeholders and mobilization of resources from outside the latecomer country itself.

In contrast to the typical policy recommendations of catching-up literature which narrowly emphasize technological capability upgrading, our framework includes the broader technology-dependent systemic contexts in which new industries form. From this perspective, other NICs that develop catching-up policies should embed conventional R&D support in a broader policy mix that equally emphasizes market formation, investment mobilization, and the legitimation of emerging industrial paths. In this venture, the state does not need to be strongly involved in a central coordinating role in all industry types. The case of manufacturing-based industries (like solar PV) showed that rather generic policy support like the accession to international free trade agreements, support for bottom-up entrepreneurial experimentation, tax incentives, as well as the repatriation of highly skilled technology experts may be sufficient to create and anchor significant industrial activities.

A more general lesson for other NICs wishing to catch-up in renewable energy industries—such as in the case of wind power in South Africa and Chile (Pueyo et al., 2011, Rennkamp and Boyd, 2015) or solar PV in India (Fu & Zhang, 2011)—is that many of the described policy interventions are not unique to China’s particular governance system, but could be replicated elsewhere after adaptation to local contexts. Developing policy mixes that reflect various industry types, ensuring flexibility in policymaking and establishing beneficial preconditions for profiting from international developments may be successfully pursued in these other contexts, even if the concrete policy instrument will substantially differ from China’s experience.

It goes without saying that our results have limitations that warrant future research. The policy mixes listed in Table 2 provide a first heuristic to develop more technology-specific policy mixes, but the framework needs significant improvements in various dimensions. First, we already identified instances where presumably well-aligned policy mixes did not result in effective sector build-up (such as in the early phase of the solar PV industry). Additional work is needed to investigate in detail the factors that resulted in ineffective policy outcomes, in spite of well-adapted policy interventions.

Second, our empirical validation covered only clean-tech industries, which by themselves may share specific (technology) characteristics that are of lesser importance in other industries that were in the focus of most catching-up studies, like cars, semi-conductors, telecom, etc. We thus strongly encourage the application of this heuristic to additional industries and geographic contexts to further validate its key claims and increase their (analytical) generalizability.

Third, our framework provides promising overlaps to related streams of literature in economic geography, development, and innovation studies, e.g., our findings support recent arguments in the varieties of capitalism literature that China has to be conceptualized not as a monolithic governance mode, but as a conglomerate of different VoC types (Zhang & Peck, 2016), which support industry formation in spatially distinct ways. Future work could draw on this literature to further explore which parts of our results are attributable to a unique “Chinese” context and which may be generalizable to countries with differing institutional arrangements.

Transforming shortcomings into opportunities: Can market incentives solve Lebanon's energy crisis?,"Over the past decades Lebanon's energy sector has been largely ignored and this has led to high economic and environmental costs. The sector is characterized by electricity poverty, an expanding and mainly unregulated transport sector and a lack of energy savings spanning through all sectors of the economy. Recently, the Government of Lebanon has committed to increase the share of renewable energy to 10% of the total energy supply by 2013 and to 12% by the year 2020; it also aims at reducing energy consumption by 6% by the year 2013. This paper aims at contributing to the formulation of a more comprehensive energy strategy for Lebanon by analyzing the recent changes in policy direction and by recommending legal, regulatory and policy measures in order to transform current shortcomings into opportunities allowing the country to become a regional ‘success story’ in the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Research highlights
 This paper reviews the current situation of Lebanon's energy sector.  We analyze the recent development of the markets for renewable energy and energy efficiency.  Policy recommendations that will allow for a sustainable energy future are made. In this paper we have presented the current challenges and the recent move towards  and EE in the Lebanese energy sector. We have shown that Lebanon has clearly taken the path to a more sustainable energy future, and we have formulated policy recommendations that can contribute to solving the country's energy crisis. A market based approach, in which the government provides the legal, regulatory and policy framework and lets market forces operate freely, would most probably attract sufficient private investments and allow to by-pass lengthy political processes with uncertain outcomes. Both political instability and the confirmation of exploitable national gas reserves will certainly slow down the development of the markets for  and EE. Given the recent progress in market development, it is however very unlikely that the shift towards sustainability in the energy sector will be reversed. In fact, the increased awareness might even lead to a more careful handling of the newly discovered gas reserves.",Energy Policy,,
"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back: How Politics Dim the Lights on Turkey’s Renewable Energy Future","This paper analyses the politics of renewable energy in Turkey by discussing the opportunities as well as the constraints facing decision makers in their attempt to create an attractive renewable energy investment environment. A careful study of Turkey's energy policy demonstrates that the main challenge to renewable energy reforms in Turkey is not technological or even financial but rather political. Despite external pressures for reform, political stability, favourable public opinion, and a certain level of civic activism in support of renewable energy, the Turkish government has not been able to reduce the dominance of fossil fuels in its energy policy. Populist decision making, geostrategic calculations and a political reluctance to reduce the state's dominance in the energy sector have led to the slow and limited development of renewable resources. Lack of vision and forward planning in the bureaucracy as well as collective action problems among business and environmental groups have also contributed to the inertia that is preventing a radical shift in Turkey's energy orientation. This analysis is important for dissecting policymaking in Turkey over an issue that has significant repercussions for development and economic welfare as well as national security. It is also valuable in terms of outlining some of the political barriers countries generally face in the promotion of renewable energy. Energy politics can be messy. Policymaking gets complicated as governments strive to balance the immediate energy needs of their societies with long-term ideological commitments to market and environmental reforms. However, at a time of increased supply insecurity, energy costs and environmental degradation in the world, the benefits of renewable energy can hardly be disputed. Compared to conventional energy sources, renewables offer governments both energy independence and sustainable economic development. While the need for clean energy seems obvious, the transformation to a clean energy economy is not inevitable. There are many technological and market barriers to establishing a viable renewable energy sector. Yet, it is generally believed that most of these barriers can be overcome or mitigated by effective government policies that utilise mechanisms like feed-in tariffs, purchase guarantees, rebates, etc. The clean energy leaders of the world are those countries that have intervened in their energy sectors with some combination of these tools to incentivise renewable energy production and consumption. Even though the tools of intervention are proven to be effective, not every country can successfully adopt them. The policy environment in most places is complicated by the existence of an infrastructure and mindset that have historically supported conventional forms of energy. What the Turkish experience demonstrates is that external pressures for reform, especially in response to economic crises, political stability, favourable public opinion and a certain level of civic activism, are necessary conditions for a transition to a more sustainable energy future, but by themselves they are not sufficient. What is also needed is political leadership with a long-term vision that will take the necessary- and perhaps politically painfulreforms to dismantle the monopoly of fossil fuels in the energy sector. The Turkish example also highlights the importance of a professional bureaucracy in designing and implementing consistent energy policies as well as the significance of strong business and environmental coalitions to keep clean energy on public’s agenda and pressure the governments to stick to that agenda. Only with a combination of these conditions, a growing economy like Turkey can effectively utilise its clean indigenous resources and become one of the leaders of the 21st century energy transformation.

Two ways to success expansion of renewable energies in comparison between Germany's federal states,"Expansion of renewable energies is a central pillar of the German energy transition towards a non-nuclear renewable system. The expansion rate is co-determined to a significant degree at the level of the federal states, and varies considerably from state to state. Apart from the existence of natural energy resources and general economic conditions, do parties in government play an important role for the development at the state level? We consider potentially influential factors in a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) focusing on the expansion of renewable electricity production in all 16 federal German states from 2004 to 2014. As a result, two promising ways for accelerated expansion of renewable electricity production can be identified. On the one hand, a group of economically less developed states have succeeded in promoting expansion and uses it as part of an economic modernization strategy. Within the economically more developed states, however, the party-political composition of the state governments (Green party's involvement) plays a significant role. These results also have implications for other (federal) countries beyond Germany, pointing to tailor-made policy strategies that consider these specific circumstances. This article compares varying expansion rates of renewable energy production in the German federal states. Our findings generally support studies highlighting the relevance of technical potential for the expansion of renewable energy sources (e.g. Staid and Guikema, 2013, p. 382), which is also in our analysis part of all solution paths.

In addition to this rather foreseeable finding, our result is surprising in two respects: On the one hand, (party)-political factors play a role in successful expansion of renewable electricity production in individual federal states (for similar results regarding wind energy, see Goetzke and Rave, 2016), but less than expected regarding the theoretical assumptions (H4). Only in one out of 51 cases does a change to Green party involvement in government seem to have genuinely been the reason for greater expansion. This finding thus only partly sustains other studies’ results highlighting a relevant role of Green party support for the expansion of wind energy in Germany (Goetzke and Rave, 2016, 8).

In most other cases, however, governments attach priority to the economic benefits of renewables. The Renewable Energy Sources Act apparently ensures that prosperity is not a prerequisite for costly expansion of this energy form, but, rather, a factor whose absence provides an incentive to exploit existing potentials for renewables and, thus, to profit from guaranteed sponsorship. This strategy to utilize existing potential is very clearly evident in states with a weaker economic base and a low share of industry. By contrast, the readiness to exploit potentials is significantly lower in states with a strong industry and sufficient financial capacity. Therefore, it seems generally plausible that sufficient potential, although an important initial condition for successful expansion (and also existent in 20 of 21 successful cases), is most likely to be utilized, given ideological and, in particular, economic incentives. This result makes sense against the backdrop of findings from earlier studies reporting a positive effect from the installation of renewables on local employment and municipal value added (Heinbach et al., 2014, p. 7). We would thus also conclude that in some states the expansion of renewables “appears to be perceived as a means of securing economic and labour market benefits” (Goetzke and Rave, 2016, p. 12). In more general terms, the finding that also poorer regions can contribute to clean energy transitions also resonates well with findings of continued expansion of renewables in economic crisis torn countries in Europe (Andreas et al., 2017, p. 86), or a positive effect from income equality and thus higher general development on CO2 emission levels (Jorgenson et al., 2017).

The importance of the economic path in our analysis underscores the special importance of political and institutional factors in the form of the Renewable Energy Sources Act as a scope condition for the results. Without the incentive of guaranteed feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewables, the dynamics of expansion would probably be significantly lower in the states. It remains unclear, however, exactly how this incentive works: Do federal states with “Low share of industry” and limited financial capacities have a special incentive for liberal regulation of expansion of renewable electricity generation, thereby attracting more investment than do states with potential but stricter requirements? Or do the strong industrial sectors of states use the power at their disposal to block development of those energy sources that are not as appealing to them, as theoretically presumed at the beginning? These questions concerning the exact effect of the explanatory factors identified for successful expansion in this investigation are to be examined in the future in detailed process tracing analyses that allow for a stronger focus on the activities of actors and employed policy instruments at the state level. At the same time, it is important to ask for the exact policy instruments employed at the state level (policy outcome) and their contribution to the successful expansion of renewable electricity production. What effects do they have looking also on the regional level (see Galvin, 2018)?

The results have also implications for other (federal) countries beyond Germany aiming at the expansion of their renewable electricity production. Financial incentives set at the central level can work to promote the expansion of renewables, especially in poor states, which can use it as part of their economic development and modernization strategy. Offering this kind of support helps to make the expansion of renewables independent from states’ affluence and increases the likelihood that existing potential is used. Basing one's strategy only on richer states that can afford expansion seems not to suffice, as their decisions for renewables appear to be more mixed. Tailor made strategies addressing the specific and varying needs at the state level can, thus, be a crucial element to boost expansion, as goals of development and the ‘greening’ of electricity production can go together.",Energy Policy,,
Understanding Stakeholders’ Influence on Project Success with a New SNA Method: A Case Study of the Green Retrofit in China,"Stakeholders strongly influence project success, particularly for complex projects with heterogeneous stakeholders, and hence, understanding their influence is essential for project management and implementation. This paper proposes an original model based on social network analysis (SNA), which first introduces critical success factors (CSFs) as intermediate variables between stakeholders and project success. The model can demonstrate the interrelation between stakeholders and CSFs, and the results can reveal how stakeholders influence project success. Green retrofit is a typical type of complex project. The stakeholder relationship in green retrofit projects is more complex than in new projects, since more stakeholders (e.g., tenants and facility managers) who have particular interrelations (e.g., lease contract and split incentives between owners and tenants) are involved. Therefore, a case study of green retrofit in China was conducted to illustrate how the proposed model works. The results indicated the priorities and similarities of stakeholders in green retrofit. Stakeholders are categorized into five clusters according to their relationship. Based on the results, the important role of stakeholders in green retrofit projects was discussed. The main contribution of this study is providing a novel method to reveal how stakeholders influence the success of complex projects. Understanding the influence of stakeholders on project success is essential in project management, particularly in projects with complex stakeholder relationships. However, previous studies focused mainly on stakeholder identification and prioritization, rather than on their influence on the success of projects. This study develops an original two-mode network model to analyze stakeholders’ influence on success. CSFs are introduced as intermediate variables between stakeholders and project success. The relationship between stakeholders and CSFs could be modeled using the two-mode network. Two-mode networks are beneficial for analyzing the relationships between two groups. In this study, the relationship between the stakeholders and CSFs was modeled using a two-mode network, through which the former’s influence on the latter is revealed, and the influence on success can be better understood in advance. The proposed model could be used in stakeholder management, risk analysis and critical factor control, which can improve project management in the following respects: (1) helping project managers focus on the stakeholders who influence project success more significantly; (2) facilitating resource assignment so that the limited resources can be allocated effectively and efficiently; (3) providing details of anticipated opportunities and problems for the PM at the early stages of projects so that teams have adequate time to manage them.
A case study on green retrofit in China was conducted to illustrate how the proposed two-mode network model works. Green retrofit projects are one of the most complex and risky types of projects, and hence, stakeholder analysis in a green retrofit project is important. First, stakeholders and CSFs were identified through a literature review and interviews with experts. Then the links between them were assessed using a workshop. Based on the results of the workshop, a stakeholder-CSF two-mode network was visualized to illustrate the relationship between these two groups. The two-mode network was projected to the one-mode network of stakeholders, where the closeness of stakeholders is shown in the value of the links. Prioritization was ranked using three centrality methods, and the result indicates the four most important stakeholders are owners/clients, property managers, designers, and government. Five clusters, which involve similar stakeholders, were developed. The results indicate that for retrofit projects a key stakeholder—the occupier—is surprisingly underestimated in prioritization and should receive greater focus in future research and projects. The results of this two-mode network analysis can help in the understanding of the characteristics of stakeholders and how they influence project success. When there is a problem in a project, the most related stakeholders can be quickly identified and controlled through prioritization and clustering methods. Then, the related stakeholders can be efficiently gathered to address the problem. Therefore, based on the proposed model, stakeholder management can be improved to become more effective, efficient, and accurate.
The study has two research limitations. First, the interviewees were all internal stakeholders involved in previous energy efficiency retrofit projects. External stakeholders, such as the media, were excluded. Second, since China only began to promote green retrofit in recent years, the number of experienced experts is limited. The aim of the case study is to illustrate how the proposed model is applied. In further studies, more case studies should be conducted and more stakeholders should be involved to obtain more concrete findings.
The proposed research method and analytical model can also be applied to other research areas. Aside from green retrofit projects, other projects or organizations with complex stakeholder relationships, such as mega projects and infrastructure construction projects, can be studied using the proposed model. In addition, the proposed model can also be applied to analyze the relationships between stakeholders and other factors, including stakeholder influence on delay, risk, and the quality of projects.",Sustainability,,
Understanding the absence of renewable electricity imports to the European Union,"This paper aims to analyse reasons for the absence of renewable electricity () imports to the European Union, for which the authors develop a multi-level heuristic.

Design/methodology/approach
The heuristic covers three sequential acceptance levels: political attractiveness (macro-level), the “business case” (micro-level) and civil society perspectives (public discourse level).

Findings
Numerous factors on all three levels determine the success/demise of renewables trade. So far, trade has failed on the macro-level, because European policymakers perceive that targets can be achieved domestically with significant co-benefits and because exporter countries have rapidly increasing electricity demand, limiting the realisable exports. As policymakers deemed it unattractive, they have not implemented policy-supported business cases. Public opposition against trade has not been an issue as no concrete plans or projects have been proposed.

Research limitations/implications
The authors show that the factors determining whether a  programme is successful are plentiful and extend far beyond potential cost savings. This suggests that future research and the energy policy debate should better account for how cost savings are weighed against other policy aims and explicitly include the perspectives of investors and the public. We identified 24 factors of importance for the success or failure of Article 9 of the EU Renewables Directive, relevant on three different levels in exporter, transit and importer countries. We find that Article 9 has failed because EU policymakers perceive that they can better reach the targets domestically and with higher co-benefits such as new jobs and local value creation: importing  would be cheaper, but at the cost of losing other benefits. In addition, most exporter states have rapidly rising electricity demand, greatly limiting the room for exports in the short- and mid-term: at least for now, the exporters have no surplus  to sell. Even if trade was deemed desirable, the required import infrastructure to the EU is lacking, making  trade under Article 9 practically impossible within this decade.

In this paper, we developed a multi-level heuristic for analysis of renewable energy programmes. We suggest that a programme must not only be attractive to different types of actors on different levels but also this must happen in a specific order: first, a dominant policy coalition must evaluate the programme as attractive; second, investors must find the business case, largely defined by policy, attractive; third, the public must accept, or at least not actively oppose, both the programme as a whole and its individual projects.

The sequential nature of our heuristic is an important contribution to the energy policy literature and debate: had we looked at all levels simultaneously, we would have arrived at similar conclusions as the European Commission, stating that the business case is missing and that public support may be lacking. Although we believe that both these points are true, they are, for now, largely irrelevant: as policymakers deem Article 9 unattractive, the programme already stops at the highest level – this is why there is no business case. How investors or the general public view Article 9 is, thus, of academic interest, as the question of their perspective does not arise. Whether an  programme is successful is a highly complex issue, requiring policymakers, business communities and the public, possibly in several countries, to deem it attractive. Our analysis of factors influencing the attractiveness of  trading under Article 9 of the EU Renewables Directive highlights this complexity (Table II).

On the macro level, the attractiveness is determined by weighing political goals against each other. For an importer, the lower cost of imported  must be weighed against, for example, the industry jobs not arising in component manufacturing and operation, especially if the trade deal has a local manufacturing requirement for the exporter country. Similarly, an exporter must weigh increased income and, potentially, a new manufacturing industry against exploiting its generation sites for export and making them unavailable for domestic use. The transit country must weigh negative environmental and power system impacts against possible compensation.

On the micro level, attractiveness refers to the “business case”. This is similar to the business case for  within one country, but adds the complexity of doing international infrastructure-bound (and hence, capital-intensive) business. Electricity remuneration, risk management and infrastructure access are key issues here.

On the public discourse level, the perception of the impacts of the  trade is the main determinant. Here, the discursive construction of fairness and what is right is as important as the (future) impacts themselves.

Among these factors, we that find that three issues appear particularly important for the failure of Article 9. Of these, the first causes Article 9 to fail on the macro level, whereas the other factors will become important if  trade becomes attractive to national policymakers in the future.

Article 9 has failed because no country has had the political will to implement it. If the political will were present, a policy framework would have been implemented, or at least suggested, in at least one importer and one exporter country. Currently, no EU country allows for remuneration of non-EU  and no country has concrete plans for using Article 9; Italy is investigating a deal with Serbia, and the UK discusses including foreign  in their support scheme, but these ideas are still vague.

Three issues related to the macro-level attractiveness are prominent in the literature and kept recurring during 30 months of BETTER project stakeholder consultations:

The EU progress towards the 2020 targets is good, reducing the short-term need for  imports to Member States. The low ambition and remaining uncertainty of the 2030 and longer-term EU renewables targets diminish the rationale for cooperation. Given the relatively weak 2030 targets decided in 2014, the potential importer savings are low. Both issues make Article 9 less attractive to EU states than when the  Directive was decided in 2009.

Local and national value creation and job creation are key drivers for renewables in the EU and constitute the prime imperative for potential exports. Yet, from an EU perspective, importing electricity could mean exporting parts of these benefits. The Member States thus, so far, prefer to achieve the target domestically despite the potentially higher costs to reap these benefits themselves.

The weak interest of potential exporters is at least partially caused by their rapid domestic demand increase: all capacities are needed for domestic supply so that no surplus capacities are available for export in the short- to mid-term.

In sum, Article 9 has failed because there is no perceived need for it in the EU and the exporters have no surplus electricity to sell.

Second, the grid infrastructure for large-scale trade is not present. Yet, without it, no electricity can be physically imported to the EU, but physical import is a requirement of Article 9. The existing 600-MW link between Morocco and Spain, which currently transports electricity from north to south, could be the first seed of a western Mediterranean cooperation, but Spain – which is currently oversupplied with electricity – has a very weak interest to allow imports to Europe via Spain. Indeed, Spain is the only country to have explicitly turned down a concrete trade deal (as a transit country in the German–Moroccan Desertec deal). Hence, even if generation investments for exports were profitable, it would be difficult or impossible to import the electricity to Europe. Given the long lead times for transmission lines, mentionable  exports to the EU can be practically ruled out before 2020, and probably well into the 2020s, even if all other barriers were immediately resolved.

What are retail investors' risk-return preferences towards renewable energy projects? A choice experiment in Germany,"Citizens own nearly half the renewable energy generation capacity in Germany and have been important drivers of the country's energy transition. In contrast to citizens' important role in financing renewable energies, the energy policy and economics literature has traditionally focused on other investors, such as incumbent energy firms. To close this gap, this paper reports on a large-scale survey of 1,990 German retail investors. Conducting a choice experiment with the subset of 1,041 respondents who expressed an interest in investing in community renewable energy projects, we present a unique dataset allowing for new insights in risk-return expectations of retail investors. We find that apart from return on investment, respondents are particularly sensitive to the minimum holding period and the issuer of community renewable energy investment offerings. A minimum holding period of 10 years implies a risk premium of 2.76% points. A subsequent segmentation analysis shows that two groups of potential community renewable energy investors with different risk-return expectations can be identified: “local patriots” and “yield investors”. In contrast to professional investors, a majority of retail investors use simple decision rules such as calculating payback time or relying on their gut feeling when making investments. This paper has analysed the risk-return expectations of potential German community renewable energy investors. Our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to quantify retail investors' preferences for community renewable energy project features with a choice experiment. Our findings confirm the important role that citizens could play as financiers of the energy transition. Nearly half of the 1,990 German retail investors we surveyed expressed an interest in community renewable energy investment. Our choice experiment with the subset of 1,041 potential renewable energy investors revealed that return on investment is a relevant, but not the only important factor. Other attributes, such as whether the investment is offered by a municipal utility or energy cooperative rather than a financial institution, also influence investor choices. In terms of holding period, the surveyed investors appeared to have a medium-term horizon, being almost indifferent between 2 and 5 years, but requiring a risk premium of 2.76% points in case of a 10-year holding period. As for technology, our study confirms prior research in that respondents prefer investment in solar photovoltaics to wind and small hydropower. As a noteworthy observation, many retail investors based their decision on intuition or simple payback period calculation rather than more sophisticated financial analysis. Finally, we identified two distinct segments, local patriots and yield investors, which differ with regard to their preferences. While the latter require higher rates of return and have less pronounced preferences for attributes such as partner or project location, the former have a strong aversion against financial investors and are willing to forego some returns for participating in local projects, mostly in solar photovoltaics.

Our findings have important policy implications. First of all, policymakers in many countries are currently faced with incumbent electric utilities that are increasingly cash-constrained and may have difficulties in financing the necessary investments in renewable energy infrastructure. In this situation, it will be helpful for policymakers to recognise that retail investors, through community financing of renewables, have significant potential to fill the gap. Rather than designing regulatory frameworks that provide generous support to incumbents, for example through capacity reserve payments for fossil power plants, or in some extreme cases engaging in government bailouts of ailing utilities, policymakers may wish to consider unlocking the potential of community investment. Our findings, however, show that retail investors are not just purely environmentally driven altruists, but they are looking for financial returns, too. This is particularly true for the sub-segment with 46.5% of potential community investors that we coined “yield investors”. The other sub-segment, the “local patriots” accounting for just over half of the potential investors, are somewhat less financially driven, but place particular emphasis on the local embedding of renewable energy projects. Facilitating the financial contribution of those actors requires framework conditions that are conducive for energy cooperatives, and for distributed solar photovoltaics. In light of these findings, recent trends in the German policy framework, such as the shift from feed-in tariffs to tenders, have to be carefully considered with regard to potentially crowding out local players.

As any piece of research, our study is subject to some limitations that can serve as starting points for further research. First, the survey has been limited to domestic investments of German retail investors. While Germany is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets in Europe and has seen significant investment from citizens, it would obviously be interesting to investigate other markets. It would be particularly interesting to see whether cultural factors contour the importance of community renewable energy investment across countries. This could be done by comparing countries with strong traditions in cooperative modes of financing and energy provision, such as Denmark or the Netherlands, to countries that lack such traditions, such as the UK and France.

A second limitation of our study owes to the fact that we are reporting on stated preferences. While we have used adaptive choice-based analysis as a sophisticated research method that creates a realistic choice setting and minimises social desirability bias, and we are reporting on a large sample of potential investors, it would be valuable to replicate our research based on revealed preferences. While we believe that the relative preferences expressed in the choice experiments provide a robust account of underlying utilities, the magnitude of the effects should be interpreted with caution. In particular, our finding that about half of respondents are interested in community renewable energy investment, while giving an indication for which market potential exist, does not imply that all of these potential investors are going to act on their preferences tomorrow.

Finally, an interesting avenue for further research might be to combine survey methods with test markets. For example, varying the features of community renewable energy investment offerings on crowdfunding websites and then observing actual investor behaviour has a high potential to generate new insights.",Energy Policy,,
"Wind Energy Scenario, Success and Initiatives towards Renewable Energy in India—A Review","Power generation using wind has been extensively utilised, with substantial capacity add-on worldwide, during recent decades. The wind power energy sector is growing, and has turned into a great source of renewable power production. In the past decades of the 21st century, the capacity of installed wind energy has almost doubled every three years. This review paper presents the crucial facets and advancement strategies that were approved and adopted by the Government of India for intensifying the country’s own power safety, by the appropriate use of existing power sources. From India’s viewpoint, wind energy is not only utilized for power production but also to provide power in a more economical way. The particulars of India’s total energy production, contributions of numerous renewable sources and their demand are also encompassed in this paper. After an exhaustive review of the literature, detailed facts have been identified about the present position of wind energy, with an emphasis on government achievements, targets, initiatives, and various strategic advances in the wind power sector. Wind power potential is discussed, which can assist renewable power companies to select efficient and productive locations. All analyses carried out in this paper will be incredibly valuable to future renewable energy investors and researchers. The current scenario of wind power production in India is also paralleled with that of other globally prominent countries.  Presently, India is finally defeating the tremendous challenge of the shortage of electricity, which may lead to lesser utilization of fossil fuels and greater utilization of Renewable Energy Sources. The Indian Government has taken a number of significant steps to encourage wind power, to build India a vast wind potential nation. The success of initiatives taken by the Indian Government to encourage wind power projects can be observed with the trend of exponentially growing annual capacity additions. India also plays a significant role in enhancing opportunities for employment, besides minimizing power shortages and carbon emissions. In recent years, several new policies have been introduced in India in the wind power sector that appear to be a sturdy agent in the remarkable development of the wind power markets. In various countries, wind power policies include several benefits such as subsidies, tax exemption, attractive financing options such as lower interest rates, and the involvement of research institutes, etc. Additionally, in several countries (including India), the idea of the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) has been initiated. Additionally, renewable power is the best choice for Indian villages that are unable to receive power supply. It also assessed that up to 400,000 megawatts of power could be required by 2022. Therefore, India needs to utilize all existing Renewable Energy Sourcess in order to reach the country’s electricity needs. Presently, India has been included among the top five nations worldwide for the creation of job opportunities in the field of renewable power, installations and capacity additions. Wind power development can be a major tool for reducing import dependence and production cost, and maximizing power security.
India has significant wind power potential, and it could be one of the leading sources of power in the near future. For effective execution of various policies, socio-economic, environmental, financial and technical hurdles, along with uncertainties in policy matters, are required to be overcome. In addition, offshore wind projects are the most efficient method of utilizing wind energy in India. However, in India, offshore wind generation remained undeveloped until 2015, and little progress has been made in this area. Therefore, resource assessment and strong policies to commercialize offshore projects must be taken into consideration. The Indian Government has a target of achieving a wind power capacity of up to 60 gigawatts by 2022. However, according to former trends, the annual capacity addition is not above 4 gigawatts; however it requires almost 6 gigawatts annual capacity addition to achieve the target of 60 gigawatts. This can only be achievable with the superior integration of infrastructure, technology and management in the power sector. Promoting research and development activities, and developing financially stable institutional centers of research in every windy state, could be beneficial. Additionally, regular inspections and monitoring of existing projects should be executed more frequently. To achieve desired targets, the re-powering of projects and an initiative that can assist in achieving the intended goal, an independent policy framework is required. Even while new initiatives implemented by Indian government have long-term consequences, they must be carefully analyzed, and policy execution must be ensured by the government in order to achieve the goal of 60 gigawatts by 2022. A well-connected grid network, devoted research centers, modifications in policies and energy prices with ongoing market trends, effective policy implementations and attractive incentives for projects can set wind power markets of India ahead of the other leading nations",Energy Policy,,
