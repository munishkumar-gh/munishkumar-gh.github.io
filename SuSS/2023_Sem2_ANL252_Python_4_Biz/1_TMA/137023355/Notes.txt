these are valid references and you need to show some examples of what you mean in each point for full credit

a few more would be appreciated. Also your suggestions while valid are hard to implement. A few more concrete actionable suggestions would be appretiated

so, I don’t know if comments were left deliberately out, but you should comment your codes
also, explain what some of the modules and functions you use are to really elevate your answer


e.g. describe a “print” or “input” module in python referencing the documentation


Using functions, loops, try-except.....this would elevate your answer


were comments left out deliberately? 

Can you point out some modules or functions or the coding modalities you used here? E.g. what is input? And than ref the documentation on python to explain your answer.

It would be better to number the line of the code so you can ref them in your explanaiton


These changes are not significant, and mostly cosmetic.
You could use dict, functions, try-except
