Supervisors please remember to:
•	Create zoom virtual meeting on Canvas in your own T group. 
•	invite your 2nd marker.
•	Inform your students of the link and time (I have also published an announcement to inform them of the schedule).
•	Get your students to deposit their .ppt slides here immediately after the presentation.
