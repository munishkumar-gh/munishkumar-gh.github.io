# Car sales program:
# Modify the Car sales program in a way that the car brands are
# stored as the keys of a dictionary. The value of the corresponding
# dictionary key is a sub-dictionary in which the model is used
# as key and the price is stored as value.

# Note that we should only have one key for each brand
# in the dictionary. That means, if the user enters multiple cars
# for the same brand, the value of that key should be a
# sub-dictionary which contains multiple keys. And the value
# for each of the key in the sub-dictionary is the price of one
# model.
