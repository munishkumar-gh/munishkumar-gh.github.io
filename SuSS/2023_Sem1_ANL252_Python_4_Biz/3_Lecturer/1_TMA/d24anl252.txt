1a)

In coding, plagiarism is defined as using someone else's code or solution without proper attribution or permission (Lee, 2021).

Why this happens:
•	Lack of knowledge or skill to write from scratch.
•	Laziness.
•	Pressure of meeting deadlines.
•	Lack of originality.
•	Ignorance of ethical and legal ramifications.

How one can avoid:
•	Write original code, make mistakes, and learn the logic behind what works.
•	Understand copyright laws and coding ethical principles.
•	To prevent accidental plagiarism, check the code using tools such as code plagiarism software.
•	Properly cite all third-party sources of codes or resources. Ask for permission whenever it is required.
•	Be cognizant of the guidelines when using open-source licences.
•	Respect others' intellectual property rights, and foster a culture of integrity and ethical behavior in school or the workplace
•	When in doubt about the ethical use of code, seek advice from mentors or peers.

1b) 
I wanted you to walk me through the code (its inner workings) and not just tell me how it runs. If i wanted that, I could just run it my self

1c)
Can do other things as well - use functions, different libraries, restructure the code

1d)
Good, shows  the following

A) Fn
B) Loop/ if-else
C) termination conditions
D) lists and variables


2a)

Some things to try:

• appropriate data structures such as tuple for the inventory and dictionary for storing the updated information, 
• user defined functions, as appropriate 
• checks and control mechanisms for user input such as ensuring correct data type is entered, stripping possible whitespaces entered by user and considering possible different letter casing entered by user. 


2b) 
Code works - checks are there for invalid input and terminate conditions

However, there is no user output showing what was eventually input into the database
