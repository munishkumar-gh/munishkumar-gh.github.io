1a)
Some positives for a scatter plot like this
A) Nice axis and title lables
B) Nice clear points
C) Nice use of gridding

Some negatives

Mind you for purposes of this assignment its fine

OK for table as well

1b)
Positives for a horizontal bar chart
a) Nice clear axis and title
B) Nice clear bars, no fancy colours
C) Nice use of gridding

Some negatives
A) maybe some guide lines vertically down? Because the numbers are hard to make out
B) With large numbers, you might want to use commas or plot in thousands
C) Sorting might be a good idea here

OK for table as well

1c)
Positives for a pie chart
a) Nice clear segmentation of groups
B) Godo that you included some percentages inside the chart

Some negatives
A) Would be good to also explain what a %value corresponds to in the chart
B) Do the colours signify anything? One clever way of using colour is for max to be bright colour and for min to be dull colour
C) Make the legend bigger

Table is good; you have split the number of people before calculating %.
