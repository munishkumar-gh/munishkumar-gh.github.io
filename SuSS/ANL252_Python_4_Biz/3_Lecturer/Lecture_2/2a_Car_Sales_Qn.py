# Car sales program:
# Construct a tuple of the car brands you know (e.g., Toyota, Kia, BMW,
# Chrysler, Mercedes Benz, Porsche, Fiat, etc.).

# Extend the Car sales program from Study Unit 1 by listing the car brands
# stored in the tuples and listed them out on the screen when the user is asked
# to enter the brand of the car.


# Note that the user must enter one of the brands in the tuple, i.e.,
# any brand not stored in the tuple is considered as invalid input.
# Furthermore, the exact spelling of the brand in the tuple should also be
# stored in the variable for the car brand input.
